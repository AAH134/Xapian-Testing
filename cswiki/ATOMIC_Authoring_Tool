It was created as a front end (Graphic Interface) for use ARToolKit library without having to know programming.
The first developper of ARToolkit has been Prof. Hirokazu Kato (media design lab in Japan http://imd.naist.jp/people/member/kato.html).
It was written in the programming language Processing and is licensed under the GNU GPL
