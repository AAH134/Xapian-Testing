Alaveteli is open source software to help citizens write Freedom of Information requests and automatically publish any responses. It can also be used for other similar situations, where holding organisations to account in public is useful.
It started life as the software running WhatDoTheyKnow, a UK site that publishes responses to FOI requests. The original WhatDoTheyKnow code was written primarily by Francis Irving while working for mySociety.

== The name Alaveteli ==

Alaveteli is named after Alaveteli in Finland where Anders Chydenius who was an early campaigner for Freedom of Information worked as a curate. Alaveteli was intended to be a name for the software rather than a public facing website or brand.
