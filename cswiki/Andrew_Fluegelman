July 6, 1985) was a publisher, photographerhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/0385142463, programmer and attorneyCalifornia State Bar membership records best known as the inventor of what is now known as the shareware business model for software marketing.  He was also the founding editor of both PC World and Macworld and the leader of the 1970s New Games movement which advocated the development of noncompetitive games.

==Early business career==

==="Freeware"===

Shortly after the introduction of the IBM PC, Fluegelman developed PC-Talk, a very popular and successful communications software. He wrote the program in late 1982 "Shareware: An Alternative to the High Cost of Software", Damon Camille, 1987  and marketed it under a system he called "Freeware," which he characterized as "an experiment in economics more than altruism."http://www.pc-shareware.com/quality.htm Freeware was licensed under terms that encouraged users to make voluntary payments for the software, and it allowed users to copy and redistribute the software freely as long as the license terms and text were not altered.

===Attorney===

Fluegelman was admitted to The State Bar of California in January 1971.http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_search.aspx?ms=Andrew+Fluegelman 

===Magazine editor===

Fluegelman edited PC World magazine from its introduction in 1982 until 1985, and Macworld magazine from its introduction in 1984 until 1985.

==Disappearance==

In 1985, Fluegelman, already suffering from colitis, was diagnosed with cancer. On the afternoon of July 6, 1985, he left his office in Tiburon, California. A week later, his abandoned car was found at the north end of the Golden Gate Bridge near San Francisco. His family held a memorial service for Fluegelman, and he is presumed dead, though his body has never been found. Kevin Strehlo, then an InfoWorld columnist, submitted a memorial column which mentioned that "friends say a suicide note was found inside" his car. InfoWorld rejected this column, but an online news service published it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://textfiles.fisher.hu/news/freeware.txt|title=Andrew Fluegleman: In Memoriam|author=Kevin Strehlo|date=1985-07-30|accessdate=2006-05-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060614133129/http://textfiles.fisher.hu/news/freeware.txt| archivedate= 14 June 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]sic. Note complicated provenance. The Textfiles website is said to be an archive of text postings from the days of text-based computer networking; this item is identified as being from NEWSBYTES (dated 7/30/85), an electronic publication available on The Source. NEWSBYTES says that it is the full text of an InfoWorld article that led to Strehlo's resignation from that publication "because the editors saw the last few paragraphs unfit for publication." Article says in part "Fluegelman had been missing for about a week when his car was found parked near the toll plaza on the Marin County side of the Golden Gate Bridge, the site of so many of his moments of inspiration.  Friends say a suicide note was found inside.  His family held a memorial service in New York the following Sunday. Yet, as this is being written, no body has been found.  Police still list Fluegelman as a missing person."
