Android Developer Lab is a series of mobile software developerment-focused events around the world held annually by Google. They include bootcamp and technical sessions focused on Android and give participants an excellent chance to learn about the state of the Android platform, get hands-on with the latest version of the SDK, test applications on the latest sample Android devices, get questions answered by Google engineers from the Android team as well as meet other like-minded members of the local Android developer community.
Bootcamp is a hands-on training experience where Google engineers show attendees how to get started with Android development, from Android SDK installation to the creation of Android applications.
Technical Sessions are presentations where Google engineers speak about key Android features and show developers how to use them effectively to create high quality applications.
