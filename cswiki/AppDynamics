==History and Founding==

AppDynamics was founded in April 2008 by current CEO Jyoti Bansal, a former lead software architect at Wily Technologies, a provider of application performance management technology.Demery, Paul. (February 26, 2010). "Priceline Finds a Way to Monitor its Wide World of Applications." InternetRetailer. Retrieved September 7, 2011. Bansal formed AppDynamics in response to the kinds of APM tools he had seen in the industry, which were tailored towards the demand of monolithic applications running on top of the traditional IT architectures. Such monolithic applications were becoming less common in the face of emerging, increasingly distributed architectures built with Service-Oriented Architecture principles.Subramanian, Krishnan. (October 5, 2010). "AppDynamics Prepares for the Cloud Era." CloudAve.com. Retrieved September 8, 2011. 
Bansal felt that in order to perform in these new environments, APM tools needed to not only provide visibility into the  application as well as code-level detail into specific issues, but also have the ability to dynamically act based upon what the software is able to learn about the application’s overall health and performance. Doing so would allow application owners to be more agile and better respond to rapid code releases, keeping up with their counterparts in development who were already following an agile software development philosophy. Another goal was to enable large-scale cloud monitoring, where companies with sizable deployments might need thousands of cloud-based nodes monitored — such as at Netflix, which uses AppDynamics to monitor its public cloud deployment.Cockcroft, Adrian. (March 7, 2011). "Performance Architecture for Cloud." Powerpoint presentation from Cloud Connect 2011. Retrieved September 7, 2011.
