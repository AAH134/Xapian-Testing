== History ==

In October 2003, as part of an etiquette discussion on Wikipedia, Alex T. Roshuk, then legal adviser to the Wikimedia Foundation, drafted a 1,300 word outline of mediation and arbitration. This outline evolved into the twin Mediation Committee and Arbitration Committee, formally announced by Jimmy Wales on December 4, 2003.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roshuklaw.com/ |title=Law office of Alex T. Roshuk |accessdate=2009-06-14 |last=Roshuk |first=Alex T. |year=2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090629055224/http://www.roshuklaw.com/| archivedate= 29 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Over time the concept of an "Arbitration Committee" was adopted by other communities within the Wikimedia Foundation's hosted projects.
When initially founded, the Committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into three groups of four members each.[tpl]cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/31/magazines/fortune/mysql_greatteams_fortune/index.htm |title=Secrets of Greatness: Great Teams |accessdate=2009-06-15 |last=Hyatt |first=Josh |date=2006-06-01 |work=Fortune |publisher=Time Warner [/tpl] [tpl]As of|2008[/tpl] it had decided around 371 conduct cases, with remedies varying from warnings to bans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0105/p13s02-stct.html |title=Online Wikipedia is not Britannica - but it's close |accessdate=2009-06-15 |last=Lamb |first=Gregory M. |date=2006-01-05 |work=The Christian Science Monitor [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2004/04/27/wikipedia |title=Everyone is an editor |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Williams |first=Sam |date=2004-04-27 |work=Salon.com |publisher=Salon Media Group [/tpl]

==Attention and controversies==

A statistical study published in the Emory Law Journal indicated that the Committee has generally adhered to the principles of ignoring the content of user disputes and focusing on user conduct.  The same study also found that despite every case being assessed on its own merits, a correlation emerged between the types of conduct found to have occurred and the remedies and decisions imposed by the Committee.
In 2007, an arbitrator using the username Essjay resigned from the Committee after it was found that he had made false claims about his academic qualifications and professional experiences in a New York Times interview.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/technology/12wiki.html?ex=1331352000&en=668e67bce73bf6c6&ei=5089&partner=rssyahoo&emc=rss |title=After False Claim, Wikipedia to Check Degrees |accessdate=2009-06-14 |last=Cohen |first=Noam |date=2007-03-12 |work=The New York Times [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/17/technology/17wiki.html?scp=3&sq=Arbitration%20Committee%20Wikipedia&st=cse |title=Growing Wikipedia Refines Its 'Anyone Can Edit' Policy |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Hafner |first=Katie |date=2006-06-17 |work=The New York Times [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05wikipedia.html?scp=1&sq=Essjay&st=cse |title=A Contributor to Wikipedia Has His Fictional Side |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Cohen |first=Noam |date=2007-03-05 |work=The New York Times [/tpl] In June 2009, an arbitrator who edited under the username Sam Blacketer resigned from the Committee after it became known that he had concealed his past editing in obtaining the role.
In 2009, the Committee was brought to media attention as a result of its decision to ban "all I.P. addresses owned or operated by the Church of Scientology and its associates, broadly interpreted", as part of the fourth Scientology-related case.  Such an action had "little precedent" in the eight-year history of Wikipedia and was reported on several major news services such as The New York Times, ABC News, and The Guardian.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/may/29/wikipedia-scientology |title=Wikipedia bans Church of Scientology from editing |accessdate=2009-06-14 |last=Fitzsimmons |first=Caitlin |date=2009-05-29 |work=The Guardian | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090611225227/http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/may/29/wikipedia-scientology| archivedate= 11 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/Technology/AheadoftheCurve/story?id=7708616&page=1 |title=Wikipedia Blocks Church of Scientology From Editing Entries |accessdate=2009-06-14 |last=Heussner |first=Ki Mae |coauthors=Ned Potter |date=2009-05-29 |publisher=ABC News | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090602204246/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/AheadoftheCurve/Story?id=7708616&page=1| archivedate= 2 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  Satirical news-show host Stephen Colbert ran a segment on The Colbert Report parodying the ban.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/229645/june-04-2009/wikipedia-bans-scientologists |title=Wikipedia Bans Scientologists |accessdate=2009-06-14 |last=Colbert |first=Stephen |date=2009-06-04 |format=Flash Player |work=Comedy Central |publisher=MTV Networks | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090608053304/http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/229645/june-04-2009/wikipedia-bans-scientologists| archivedate= 8 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

== Arbitration committees on sister projects ==

In 2007, an Arbitration Committee was founded on the German Wikipedia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Wikipedia-sucht-Schiedsrichter--/meldung/89083 |title=Wikipedia sucht Schiedsrichter |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Kleinz |first=Torsten |date=2007-04-30 |publisher=Heise Online |language=German | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090501114321/http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Wikipedia-sucht-Schiedsrichter--/meldung/89083| archivedate= 1 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] as well as Polish Wikipedia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Wikipedia-sucht-Schiedsrichter--/meldung/89083 |title=Komitet arbitrażowy oraz mediatorzy w Wikipedii|accessdate=2012-02-01 ||date=2007-08-31 |publisher=Blog wikipedystyczny|language=Polish[/tpl]  Based on the model used on the English Wikipedia, the German Schiedsgericht and Polish Komitet Arbitrażowy consist of individuals elected by the editing community to resolve disputes by imposing final decisions.
