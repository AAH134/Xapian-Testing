The software is an evolution of Google's Voice Actions that is currently available on most Android phones while adding natural language processing. Where Voice Actions required the users to issue specific commands like "send text to…" or "navigate to…", "Assistant" will allow the users to perform actions in their natural language similar to how Siri functions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://androidandme.com/2011/12/news/googles-response-to-siri-is-codenamed-majel-could-be-released-by-end-of-year/ |title=Google’s response to Siri is codenamed Majel, could be released by end of year |publisher=Android and Me |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2011-12-28[/tpl] According to search engineer Mike Cohen, the "Assistant" project has three parts: "getting the world's knowledge into a format a computer can understand, creating a personalization layer; building a mobile, voice-centered "Do engine" ('Assistant') that's less about returning search results and more about accomplishing real-life goals".
