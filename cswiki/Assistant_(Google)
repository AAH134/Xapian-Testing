Assistant is the codename of a rumored upcoming Google application that will integrate voice recognition and a virtual assistant into Android in the same way as the S Voice feature used in certain Samsung phones.http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Search-Engines/Google-Majel-May-Answer-Apple-Siri-798344/ It is expected to launch in Q4 of 2012.http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/02/2011-was-the-year-of-social-for-google-2012-is-the-year-of-assistant/ Before March 2, 2012, the project was known as "Google Majel", and that name was originated from Majel Barrett-Roddenberry, the actress best known as the voice of the Federation Computer from Star Trek.http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/16/google_siri_will_be_called_majel/
The software is an evolution of Google's Voice Actions that is currently available on most Android phones while adding natural language processing. Where Voice Actions required the users to issue specific commands like "send text to…" or "navigate to…", "Assistant" will allow the users to perform actions in their natural language similar to how Siri functions. According to search engineer Mike Cohen, the "Assistant" project has three parts: "getting the world's knowledge into a format a computer can understand, creating a personalization layer; building a mobile, voice-centered "Do engine" ('Assistant') that's less about returning search results and more about accomplishing real-life goals".
