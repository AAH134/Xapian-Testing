Atomic Terrace Low Angle Shadowing (ATLAS) is a technique for the fabrication  of material independent planar arrays of nanowires.[ref]
</ref> The technique involves the low angle incidence of flux material on vicinal substrates. Vicinal [[Thin-film|substrates]] comprise of atomic terraces separated by atomic steps. The ATLAS technique allows for the fabrication of well defined planar arrays of [[plasmon]]ic [[nanostructure]]s, of dimensions unachievable by [[lithography]].
