==History==

AVAST Software timeline[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.avast.com/history|title=Avast! history and origins|accessdate=2012-03-19[/tpl]:
* 2012 - As of Q2, Avast! had more than 150 million active users and over 211 million user registrations – with just over 200 employees. New product launches included a new version of Avast! Free Antivirus for Mac; the Avast! Endpoint Protection business security line; and the Avast! 7.0 series, with innovations that included FileRep (a cloud-based file reputation warning system), streaming updates (also cloud-based), and Remote Assistance capabilities.
* 2011 – By midyear, Avast! had more than 135 million active users and over 165 million user registrations – with just over 150 employees. New product launches included Avast! Business Protection line (with a simplified central administration console); Avast! 6.0 series, with new innovations that included: WebRep (a website reputation tool), SafeZone™ (a built-in browser, using the Chromium source code, for safety with sensitive online transactions), and AutoSandbox (the first automatic virtualization feature offered within a free antivirus).
* 2010 – Summit Partners invested $100 million for a minority share of the company. Said Han Sikkens, a Principal in Summit Partners, “it is rare to find a company such as AVAST that redefines how an industry does business. We are very excited about the growth prospects of this exceptional company." As well, ALWIL Software changed its name to AVAST Software, to more closely align the company with the brand, and Avast! reached 130 million registered users. New product launches included Avast! 5.0 series, with a new antivirus engine and an optional silent firewall and virtualization sandbox. 
* 2009 – To strengthen the team, ALWIL hired Vincent Steckler (formerly of Symantec) as CEO. The Avast! registered-user base jumped from 68 million to over 100 million, and the company reached 100 employees. New product launches included the 5.0 series of Avast! Free Antivirus, Avast! Pro Antivirus, and Avast! Internet Security.
* 2008 – ALWIL put major focus on acquiring a multinational sales and support team and localizing Avast! antivirus and Avast.com into more languages. The company reached 50 million registered users and 60 employees. New product launches included Avast! 4.8.
* 2007 – The company reached 40 million registered Avast! users with only 38 employees, for a ratio of one million users per employee. ALWIL Software transformed into a joint stock company. New product launches included Avast! Mac Edition and Avast! Windows Home Server Edition.
* 2006 – The Avast! user base doubled twice, first to 10 million and then to 20 million by year’s end, in large part due to the availability of more language versions and a number of industry awards for quality. Avast! swept the SC Awards categories with Best Antivirus, as well as Anti-Malware (European) and Readers' Choice (USA). New product launches included Avast! Linux Home Edition.
* 2005 – As a way for Avast! to reach new users at a time when the internet did not have such high penetration, ALWIL began cooperation with SanDisk. Thanks to this partnership, Avast! needed language localization for all SanDisk markets. Thus, ALWIL hired the first people for in-house localization and support, which was the first step toward Avast! supporting a wide range of languages. New product launches included Avast! U3 Edition (for SanDisk) and Avast! 4.6.
* 2004 – Only 30 months after its first user registration, the free version of Avast! reached one million users. Until this time, management remained uncertain as to whether giving for free what others sell would work, but reaching one million users confirmed a successful increase in visibility for the company. ALWIL also implemented an international reseller channel for its paid-for security solutions. New product launches included Avast! Linux version, Avast! 4.5 Home/Professional edition, Avast! Distributed Network Manager (ADNM), and Avast! BART CD 2.0. 
* 2003 – The growing free Avast! user base generated a need to offer other paid-for solutions effectively online. Thus, ALWIL turned to Digital River’s online sales distribution share-it! New product launches included Avast! Bootable Antivirus & Recovery Tool (BART) CD and the (free) Avast! 4 Home Edition (under Ondrej Vlček's R&D supervision).
* 2001 – Co-founder Eduard Kučera implemented a user-community growth strategy based on the principle that all computer users deserve protection from harmful threats, and that computer safety should not be a luxury some cannot afford. Thus, on June 1, ALWIL Software launched a free antivirus solution for home (non-commercial) use. Six months later (January, 2002), a new registration system saw the very first user registration of free Avast! antivirus Home Edition. 
* 1997 – ALWIL Software provided the Avast! antivirus engine to McAfee, which licensed it for use in its own line of McAfee antivirus products with the "Powered by Avast! engine" logo on the McAfee VirusScan boxes. Also, ALWIL hired its first tech-support specialist, Pavel Mourek.
* 1996 – Avast! antivirus was one of the first three antivirus programs globally to win Virus Bulletin’s VB100 awards in all testing categories. 
* 1995 – A young Ondrej Vlček (current AVAST CTO) joined ALWIL while completing his university studies. He wrote the first antivirus program for Windows 95.
* 1991 – Founders Pavel Baudiš and Eduard Kučera, free from the socioeconomic constraints of the former regime, transformed ALWIL Software from a ‘cooperative’ into a joint partnership ‘company’.
* 1988 – Pavel Baudiš, then a researcher at Prague’s Mathematical Machines Research Institute, encountered a sample of the Vienna Virus and, intrigued by it, wrote a program able to remove it. He then showed it to colleague Eduard Kučera and, together, they started ALWIL Software cooperative, which released the first Avast! antivirus. Due to the oppressive regime, however, they were unable to form a ‘company’ at that time.

==Features==

* Antivirus kernel based on certified antivirus engine.
* Resident protection comprising individual modules or "shields", each of which can be individually configured or disabled:
** File System Shield — Real-time protection against viruses and other malware threats. Scans files as they run on your computer to keep viruses from being able to execute.
** Mail Shield  — Scans messages and attachments in E-mail/Microsoft Outlook/Exchange for viruses.
** Web Shield — HTTP protection (local transparent proxy). Version 4.8 also allows the blocking of URLs. Scans URLs and incoming data for viruses, and aborts connections to the site if one is found.
** P2P Shield — Scans P2P files from file share programs.
** IM Shield — Instant Messaging protection. (Scanning of files transferred through instant messaging applications)
** Script Shield — Scans webpages for malicious scripts, and disables them from infecting your computer, though they can still be used (for example, a clickable button.)
** Network Shield — Basic protection against well-known network worms. Acts as an Intrusion Detection System.
** Behavior Shield — Reports suspicious behavior by analyzing the behavior of programs
* Anti-spyware capabilities
* Anti-rootkit capabilities (Powered by GMER)avast’s Top 5 Hidden Gems.
* Self-Protection — Prevents malware from terminating avast! processes and damaging avast! files.

* Audible alarms — Vocal warnings and notices such as "Threat has been detected!" and "Virus database has been updated."
* Boot-time scan — Users can schedule a boot-time scan to remove infections that load during Windows startup.
* Virus Chest — Quarantine; folder where infected files can be stored. The virus chest also stores vital system files to protect them from damage by malware. Users can also add their own files to the virus chest. Once in the chest, a file cannot be executed; double-clicking the file will instead display information about the file.
* SafeZone — SafeZone is a special web browser in avast! Pro Antivirus 6.x and avast! Internet Security 6.x based on Chromium web browser. It allows users to browse the web in a private, secure environment, invisible to the rest of the users' system.

Throughout the day, AVAST streams updates to users, giving them faster warnings about new malware. This supplements regular virus updates, keeping users informed and protected regardless of their internet connection.
* FileRep - The FileRep feature enables faster threat identification by sorting new, potentially dangerous files from known safe files. Sourced from the CommunityIQ sensor network, the data helps avast! decide when questionable files should be placed in the AutoSandbox.
* Remote Assistance — An avast! user can connect to the computer of a second avast! user, allowing the “helper-friend” to help with any computer issues.
