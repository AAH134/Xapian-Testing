==Conflict with Bijoy==

===Beginning===

On 4 April 2010, Mustafa Jabbar, the proprietor of commercial and closed source Bijoy software and CEO of 'Ananda Computers' said in an article in daily Janakantha, hackers were responsible for spreading pirated copies of his Bijoy on the internet. He accused UNDP to help these hackers. He further claimed that UNDP had remarkable influence for selecting Avro for national ID database project by Bangladesh Election Commission.[tpl]cite news | first = Mustafa | last = Jabbar | title = সাইবার যুদ্ধের যুগে প্রথম পা ॥ একুশ শতক | date = 2010-04-04 | publisher = The Daily Janakantha | url = http://www.dailyjanakantha.com/news_view.php?nc=13&dd=2010-04-04&ni=13623 | work = The Daily Janakantha | accessdate = 2010-12-16 | language = Bengali[/tpl] On the other hand, Avro developers denied  all allegation against them. In addition, they charged Jabbar for continuous harassment in different stages and media by calling them thief and for that their petition was ignored there. They said that the developers behind Bengali computing happened to work under threat of legal persecution and law enforcing agencies. They indicated that Jabbar complained against Avro after losing around 5 crore taka business in Bangladesh Election commission that used free Avro software instead of commercial Bijoy in the nation ID database project.[ref]

===Reaction===

Anger and protest have become apparent in Bangla blogosphere and Bangladeshi Facebook users for this accusation that Avro is a pirated version of ‘Bijoy‘ and that the Avro team have been called hackers.
The Avro team was praised for saving around 5 crore taka of Bangladesh Election commission.

===Legal proceeding===

There is a keyboard layout, named UniBijoy, which was supplied with Avro Keyboard 4.5.1. Jabbar filed an application of copyright violation to the office of copyright, Bangladesh on 25 April 2010, claiming that UniBijoy is a copy of Bijoy.

===Settlement===

A settlement was made between khan and Jabbar in a formal meeting on 16 June 2010 in Bangladesh Computer Council office in Agargaon, Dhaka at presence of many IT experts. According to that, Khan removes the UniBijoy keyboard layout from Avro keyboard software and Jabbar withdraws the allegation of copyright violation from Bangladesh copyright office by 20 August 2010.[ref]
</ref> As a result, UniBijoy keyboard layout was removed from the Avro Keyboard version 4.5.2 which was released on 20 August 2010. Jabbar informed that the trial in copy right office is withheld and will be withdrawn.<ref>
</ref> He congratulated Khan and said, I am respectful to his creativity and expecting the development of Avro software.<ref>
