BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine) is a multi-disciplinary search engine to scholarly internet resources, created by Bielefeld University Library in Bielefeld, Germany. It is based on search technology provided by Fast Search & Transfer (FAST), a Norwegian company. It harvests OAI metadata from scientific digital repositories that implement the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), and are indexed using FAST's software. In addition to OAI metadata, the library indexes selected web sites and local data collections, all of which can be searched via a single search interface.
It allows those who use the search engine to search metadata, when available, as well as conducting full text searches. It contrasts with commercial search engines in multiple ways, including in the types and kinds of resources it searches and the information it offers about the results it finds. Where available, bibliographic data is provided, and the results may be sorted by multiple fields, such as by author or year of publication.
