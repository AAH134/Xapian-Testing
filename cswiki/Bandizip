*Support unicode to display international characters which display for filenames in archives
*Files with poor compressibility are merely added to archives without compression when using the High Speed Archiving function."Zippy zipping with BandiZip" - Product Review by CNET staff October 17, 2011
*Files can be directly extracted to a destination folder, which bypasses a temporary directory, when using the Fast Drag & Drop function.  This results in less drive accessing and writing and decreased wait time during extraction.
