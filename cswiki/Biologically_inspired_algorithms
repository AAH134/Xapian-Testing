Biologically inspired algorithms is a category of algorithms that imitate the way nature performs. This category has been quite popular, since numerous problems can be solved without rigorous mathematical approaches.
In this category of algorithms fall:
*Artificial neural networks
*Genetic algorithms
*Evolutionary algorithms
*Particle swarm optimization
*Ant colony optimization
*Fuzzy logic
*and others
