The Bionic libc is a derivation of the BSD standard C library code that was originally developed by Google for the Android embedded system operating system. Bionic has several major Linux-specific features and development continues independent of other code bases. The publicly-stated goals for Bionic are:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/patrick-brady-dissects-android/584|title=Patrick Brady dissects Android|first=Ed|last=Burnette|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=ZDNet[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/android-platform/browse_thread/thread/bb85ef641ed093ea/a43090bfd365cd75|title=Questions about Bionic |first=David|last=Turner|date=2009-02-07|quote=The name "Bionic" comes from the fact that it is part-BSD and part-Linux: its source code consists in a mix of BSD C library pieces with custom Linux-specific bits used to deal with threads, processes, signals and a few others things.[/tpl]
# BSD license: Android uses a Linux kernel which is under the GNU General Public License (GPL), but Google wished to isolate Android applications from the effects of the GPL. However, GNU libc which is normally used with the Linux kernel is under the GNU LGPL, as is the alternative uClibc.
# Small size: Bionic is much smaller than glibc and somewhat smaller than uclibc.
# Speed: Bionic is designed for CPUs at relatively low clock frequencies.
Bionic lacks many features found in full libc implementations, such as wide character and C++ exception handling support[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.hackoids.com/2012/04/25/bionic/|title=Dive into Android’s libraries – Bionic|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Hackoids[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://codingrelic.geekhold.com/2008/11/six-million-dollar-libc.html|title=The Six Million Dollar LibC |first=Denton|last=Gentry|date=2008-11-28[/tpl]. Also some functions defined in the Bionic header are still unimplemented, which may trigger unexpected behavior in some cases[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/php-for-android/issues/detail?id=7|title=Not working on Xoom/Android 3.0 Honeycomb|date=2011-04-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/android-porting/browse_thread/thread/5f68cc06b834a19a|title=getmntent() is not implemented in bionic/libc/bionic/stubs.c|date=2011-02-25[/tpl].
The recommended way of directly using and extending Bionic is with the Android Native Development Kit.
