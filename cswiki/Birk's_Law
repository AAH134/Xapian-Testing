Birks' Law  is an empirical formula for the light yield per path length as a function of the energy loss per path length for a particle traversing a scintillator, and gives a relation that is not linear at high loss rates. The relation is:
1.26-2.07 MeV/g cm^2 for polyvinyltoluene-based scintillators  
Birks speculated that the loss of linearity is due to recombination and quenching effects between the excited molecules and
the surrounding substrate.  Birks' Law has mostly been tested for organic scintillators.  Its applicability to inorganic scintillators is debated.  A good discussion can be found at
