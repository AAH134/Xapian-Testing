== Concept ==

The concept behind Blackle is that computer monitors can be made to use less energy by displaying much darker colors. Blackle is based on a study which tested a variety of CRT and LCD monitors. There is dispute over whether there really are any energy saving effects, especially for users of LCD screens, where there is a constant back light, while pixel shaders are used to display various colors.[ref]

This concept was first brought to the attention of Efap Media by a blog post, which estimated that Google could save 750 megawatt hours a year by utilizing it for CRT screens.[tpl]Cite news | title = Search site cashes in on eco-guilt |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/search-site-cashes-in-on-ecoguilt/2007/08/01/1185647951527.html |last=Moses |first = Asher |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2007-08-01[/tpl]Black Google Would Save 750 Megawatt-hours a Year, by ecoIron. The blog post by that inspired Blackle. The homepage of Blackle provides a count of the number of watt hours claimed to have been saved by enabling this concept.
