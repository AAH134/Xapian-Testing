== History ==

BleachBit was first publicly released released on 24 December 2008 for GNU/Linux systems.http://bleachbit.blogspot.com/2008/12/bleachbits-public-debut.html The 0.2.1 release created some controversyhttp://lwn.net/Articles/313679/ by suggesting GNU/Linux needed a registry cleaner.
Version 0.4.0 introduced CleanerML,http://bleachbit.blogspot.com/2009/02/bleachbit-040-cleaner.html a standards-based markup language for writing new cleaners. On May 29, 2009, BleachBit version 0.5.0 added support for Windows XP, Vista, and 7.http://bleachbit.blogspot.com/2009/05/bleachbit-050-released.html On September 16, 2009, version 0.6.4 introduced command line support.http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/news/bleachbit-064-released
BleachBit is available for download through its website and the repositories of many GNU/Linux distributions.
As of October 15, 2009, BleachBit was more active than 99.972% of projects  on SourceForge, and according to the Ubuntu Popularity Contesthttp://popcon.ubuntu.com/ BleachBit was more popular than 93.44% of installed packages.

* Identifying and removing cache, cookies, Internet history, temporary files, and log files for 50 applications including Firefox, Opera, Safari, APT, Google Chrome, Flash.
* Removing unused localizations (also called locale files) which are translations of software.
* Shredding files and wiping unallocated disk space to minimize data remanence.
* Wiping unallocated disk space to improve compression ratio for disk image backups.
* Shredding any file selected by the user.

== Technology ==

BleachBit is written in the Python programming language and uses PyGTK.
Most of BleachBit's cleaners are written in CleanerML,http://bleachbit.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bleachbit/trunk/cleaners/ an XML-based markup language for writing cleaners which is an open standard.http://bleachbit.blogspot.com/2009/02/cleaner-markup-language.html CleanerML does not only deal with deleting files, but also executes more specialized actions such as vacuuming an SQLite database (used, for example, to clean Yum).
BleachBit's file shredder uses only a single passhttp://bleachbit.blogspot.com/2009/06/validating-secure-erase.html because of the lack of evidence that multiple passes, such as the 35-pass Gutmann method, are more effective.  However, multiple passes are significantly slower and may give the user a false sense of security by overshadowing other ways privacy may be compromised.
