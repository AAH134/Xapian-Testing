Bodhi Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Ubuntu, that uses the Enlightenment window manager. The philosophy for the distribution is to provide a minimal base system so that users can populate it with the software they want. Thus, by default it only includes software that is essential to most Linux users, including a file browser, a web browser and a terminal emulator. It does not include software or features that its developers deem as unnecessary. To make populating systems with software easy, Bodhi Linux developers maintain an online database of lightweight software that can be installed in one click via apturl.
In addition to the standard version of Bodhi Linux, which is for Intel-compatible processors, there is an alpha release version for tablet devices with ARM processors, based on Debian.
