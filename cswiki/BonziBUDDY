BonziBUDDY, also known as Bonzi, sometimes spelled Bonzi Buddy, BonziBuddy, BONZIBuddy (misspelled Bonzai Buddy) was an on-screen "intelligent software agent" from BONZI Software, released in 1999 and discontinued in 2004. The official website stated that the software would help a user surf the Internet by using Microsoft Agent technology. In 1999, the software used a green parrot called Peedy licensed from Microsoft, and in later versions, BONZI Software made their own fictional character, Bonzi, who was a purple gorilla. The on-screen agent would tell jokes, facts, manage downloading using his download manager, sing songs and other functions. The user would command the character by right clicking on the character's stomach on which a menu would appear.
BonziBUDDY received wide recognition as malware, predominantly as a piece of adware, though claims of spyware capabilities have been made against it. Bonzi's homepage remained open after the discontinuation of BonziBUDDY and the website disappeared at the end of 2008.
