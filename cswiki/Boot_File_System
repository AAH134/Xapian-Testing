The Boot File System (Named BFS on Linux, but BFS also refers to the Be File System) was used on UnixWare to store files necessary to its boot process.
It does not support directories, and only allows contiguous allocation for files, to make it simpler to be used by the boot loader.

==Implementations==

Besides the UnixWare support, Martin Hinner wrote a bfs kernel module for Linux that supports it.
He documented the file system layout as part of the process.
