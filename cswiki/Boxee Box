==Reception==

There have been complaints regarding the Boxee Box by D-Link in several aspects. [tpl]cite web|last=Clark |first=Shaylin |url=http://www.webpronews.com/apple-tv-google-tv-boxee-roku-which-is-best-for-consumers-2012-03 |title=Apple TV, Google TV, Boxee, Roku: Which Is Best For Consumers? |date=22 March 2012[/tpl] As of the current version it does not provide support for Hulu or Hulu Plus subscription. Also that the Boxee Box software / firmware is not production ready but rather behaves like an Alpha or Beta version, especially when compared to the older desktop version of Boxee which can be freely downloaded and installed on commodity PCs. This viewpoint is furthered by the user interface development changes that took place between the beta version and the version 1.0 software shipped with the Boxee Box, with very little public user testing or input. These interface changes place greater emphasis on streaming content versus local downloaded content. Coupled with the removal of the BitTorrent client that was present in the beta version, these changes have led users to believe there is an active shift towards subscription/pay content.[tpl]cite web|author=@boxee says |url=http://blog.boxee.tv/2010/11/10/boxee-box-starts-shipping-new-boxee-version-netflix-and-hulu-plus-too/#comments |title=Boxee Blog: Boxee Box by D-Link launches |publisher=Blog.boxee.tv |accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl] As well, there are allegations from the open source community that D-Link has gone the way of tivoization on the Boxee Box on purpose, implementing hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on the D-Link hardware, and these restrictions raise questions about whether they are allowed under the licenses of dependent software used by the Boxee Box, including Boxee, XBMC, and the Linux operating system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-DSM-380-Boxee-Box-by/product-reviews/B0038JE07O/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1 |title=Customer Reviews of the Boxee Box by D-Link by D-Link on |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Shein |first=Esther |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/infrastructure/WAN_file_services/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=228200833&cid=RSSfeed_IWK_All |title=Boxee Box Launches Without Netflix, Hulu Plus |publisher=Informationweek.com |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Foresman |first=Chris |url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/11/boxee-box-now-shipping-netflix-and-hulu-plus-coming-soon.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss |title=Boxee Box now shipping, Netflix and Hulu Plus coming soon |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=19 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?p=644441 |title=Hacking the Boxee Box to run XBMC?
