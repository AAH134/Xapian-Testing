===China===

Chinese Wikipedia was launched on May 2001.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/19/AR2006021901335.html|title=Reference Tool On Web Finds Fans, Censors|first=Philip|last=Pan|work=The Washington Post|date=20 February 2006|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=Beijing[/tpl] Wikipedia received positive coverage in China's state press in early 2004, but it was blocked on 3 June 2004 on the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Proposals to practice self-censorship in a bid to restore the site were rejected by the Chinese Wikipedia community. However, a story in the International Herald Tribune comparing entries on Chinese Wikipedia and English Wikipedia on topics such as Mao Zedong and Taiwan concluded that the Chinese entries were "watered down and sanitized" of political controversy.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500486_162-2218394-500486.html|title=Is Wikipedia China Really Wikipedia?|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=30 November 2006|accessdate=23 December 2011|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] On 22 June 2004, access to Wikipedia was restored without explanation. Wikipedia was blocked again for unknown reasons in September,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.ifex.org/china/2005/10/21/authorities_block_access_to_online/|title=Alert: Authorities block access to online encyclopaedia|date=21 October 2005|accessdate=23 October 2011|publisher=International Freedom of Expression Exchange[/tpl] but only for four days. Wikipedia was blocked in China in October 2005. Wikipedia users Shi Zhao and Cui Wei wrote letters to technicians and authorities to try to convince them to unblock the website. Part of the letter read, "By blocking Wikipedia, we lose a chance to present China's voice to the world, allowing evil cults, Taiwan independence forces and others . . . to present a distorted image of China."
In October 2006, The New York Times reported that English Wikipedia was unblocked in China, although Chinese Wikipedia remained blocked. New media researcher Andrew Lih blogged that he could not read the English-language article on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/16/technology/16wikipedia.html|title=Chinese Government Relaxes Its Total Ban on Wikipedia|first=Noam|last=Cohen|date=16 October 2006|accessdate=23 December 2011|work=The New York Times[/tpl] Lih said that "there is no monolithically operating Great Firewall of China", noting that for users of various internet service providers in different locations in China–China Netcom in Beijing, China Telecom in Shanghai, and various providers in Anhui—Chinese Wikipedia was only blocked in Anhui.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2006/10/11/china-partially-unblocks-wikipedia/| title=China PARTIALLY unblocks Wikipedia| accessdate=24 December 2006| publisher=andrewlih.com blog[/tpl] Advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders praised Wikipedia's leaders for not self-censoring.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6154444.stm|title=China 'unblocks' Wikipedia site|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=23 December 2011|publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
On 16 November 2006, Reuters news agency reported the main page of Chinese Wikipedia could be displayed, except for some taboo political subjects, such as "4 June, protests".[tpl]cite web| url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/11/16/wikipedia-unblocked-in-china-after-year-long-ban-1163687797.html| title=Wikipedia unblocked in China after year-long ban| accessdate=24 December 2006| publisher=Reuters[/tpl] However, subsequent reports suggested that both the Chinese and English versions had been reblocked the next day on 17 November.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.danwei.org/internet/the_nanny_changes_her_mind_wik.php| title=The Nanny changes her mind: Wikipedia blocked again| accessdate=24 December 2006| publisher=DANWEI[/tpl] On 15 June 2007, access to apolitical articles on English Wikipedia was restored.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/management/online/new-media/news/index.cfm?newsid=3540 |title=English Wikipedia unblocked in China |accessdate=20 June 2007[/tpl] On 6 September 2006, IDG News reported that English Wikipedia was blocked again.[tpl]cite news | last = Schwankert| first = Steven | title = Wikipedia Blocked in China Again | publisher = IDG News via PCworld | date = 6 September 2007| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,136879-c,sites/article.html| accessdate =26 January 2008 [/tpl] On 2 April 2008, The Register reported that the blocks on English and Chinese Wikipedias was lifted.[tpl]cite news | last = Barak | first = Sylvie | title = China uncensors Wikipedia | publisher = The Inquirer | date = 3 April 2008| url = http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/04/03/china-uncensors-wikipedia | accessdate =3 April 2008[/tpl] This was confirmed by the BBC, and came within the context of foreign journalists arriving in Beijing to report on the 2008 Summer Olympics and the International Olympic Committee's request for press freedom during the games."Beijing unblocks BBC Chinese site", BBC, 31 July 2008 In September 2008, Jimmy Wales had a meeting with Cai Mingzhao, Vice Director of China's State Council Information Office. While no agreements were made, Wales believes that a channel of communication has been opened between Wikipedia's community and the PRC Government.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2008/10/jimmy-wales-mee.html |title=Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales meets China's censors |publisher=Rconversation.blogs.com |date=1 October 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2011[/tpl]
Currently, both Chinese and English Wikipedias are accessible in China except for political articles. If a Chinese IP tries to access (including searching) a "sensitive" article, the IP will be blocked from visiting Wikipedia for several minutes.

=====Effects=====

On 10 November 2006, blogger Andrew Lih reported that Chinese Wikipedia appeared to have been fully unblocked.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2006/11/10/chinese-wikipedia-now-fully-unblocked/| title=Chinese Wikipedia now fully unblocked? | accessdate=24 December 2006| publisher=andrewlih.com blog[/tpl] Lih confirmed the full unblocking several days later and offered a partial analysis of the effects based on the rate of new account creation on Chinese Wikipedia. Prior to the unblocking, 300–400 new accounts were created on Chinese Wikipedia daily. In the four days after the unblocking, the rate of new registrations more than tripled to over 1,200 daily, jumping into the second fastest growing Wikipedia after the English version. Similarly, there were 75% more articles created in the week ending on 13 November than during the week before. Coming on the same weekend that Chinese Wikipedia passed the 100,000 article mark, Lih predicted that the second 100,000 would come quickly but that the existing body of Chinese Wikipedia users would have their hands full teaching the new users and teaching them basic Wikipedia policies and norms.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.andrewlih.com/blog/2006/11/13/chinese-wikipedias-surge-in-growth/| title=Chinese Wikipedia’s Surge in Growth | accessdate=24 December 2006| publisher=andrewlih.com blog[/tpl]
