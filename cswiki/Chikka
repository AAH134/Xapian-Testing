== History ==

Chikka Asia, Inc. was founded in 2000 by Chito Bustamante, Dennis Mendiola, and Alexandra Roxas. It was headquartered in Pasig City, Philippines. It operates as a subsidiary of Chikka Holdings, Ltd.[tpl]Cite web |title=Internet Software and Services: Chikka Asia, Inc. |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=28922499 |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-14[/tpl] The owners of the company wanted to devise a customer service application that would connect Internet-to-mobile communities.
In 1999, Chikka began developing the Chikka Text Messenger (CTM), which combines the features of instant messaging and SMS technology. This application was originally intended for a small e-commerce business that catered to an overseas community for the delivery of gifts to their home country, in this case, the Philippines.
It was designed to withstand SMS volume in a country sending 30 million messages daily, which made it “Text Capital of the World” in 2000.
Chikka was founded as a “dotcom” during the tail-end of the dotcom boom in 2000. A year later, the Chikka Messenger was launched. Chikka beat world players in creating an effective mobile instant messaging application, one that would marry SMS. Chikka’s solution and subsequent hold on the market was such that prevented many more global players from gaining ground in the “SMS Capital.”
The Chikka Text Messenger (CTM) was capable of translating instant messaging functionalities such as presence detection (knowing which users are online), into SMS-enabled mobile phones. Effective anti-spam and privacy features were also built-in to assure primary customers in the network operators.
Users log-on to Chikka using their mobile phone number and enjoy free instant messaging from a PC and continue to receive messages on their mobiles even when offline.
Such features are the subject of patent filings worldwide.
By the third quarter of 2002, Chikka Asia, Inc. had already launched multiple services that allowed it to seize market leadership in the local Value Added Service (VAS) SMS market in the Philippines, especially on various corporate promo applications and SMS-based games.
