CintaNotes is a shareware Microsoft Windows personal information manager that allows basic personal note keeping.  It provides a way to store and retrieve text collected from other documents or websites.  It does not support the collection of images.
CintaNotes supports clipping text from any application via a hotkey and also captures the web or local file link.  The program allows tags and has instant search based on tags, text, links or date. The entire database or individually selected notes can be exported into either Unicode text or XML format. 

==Features==

* Organization - Notes are organized using tags. The main window is divided into two parts: a tag list on the left side (sorted alphabetically) and notes on the right side. Which notes are displayed depend on which tag or tags are selected.
* Notes - each note is plain text with an optional title and optional tags. All of these parts are displayed in the notes list.
