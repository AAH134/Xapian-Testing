The Common Manageability Programming Interface (CMPI) is an open standard that defines a programming interface between a CIM server and CIM providers.

==Overview==

The CMPI standard is defined by the CMPI Working Group of The Open Group and is implementation neutral.
The CMPI programming interface is defined for the C programming language. Its C header files are enabled for C++. In addition, there are C++ utility macros that allow accessing the interface in a way that is more typical to C++.

==Benefits==

Before the introduction of CMPI, each CIM server implementation had its own specific programming interface for CIM providers (e.g. WMI COM API, OpenPegasus C++ API, OpenWBEM C++ API, etc.). CMPI allows CIM providers to be developed that are mostly or completely agnostic to the type of CIM server they are being used with. Therefore, CMPI providers can be deployed across a variety of operating environments with no or minimal adaptation work. This protects the investment in these CIM providers.

==Standards development==

The original input to the CMPI standard was submitted by IBM to The Open Group in 2003. Along with the submission, an implementation was conducted as part of the SBLIM project.
In late 2004, CMPI V1.0 was released by The Open Group as a Technical Standard.
The current version of CMPI is V2.0 and was released in late 2006.
