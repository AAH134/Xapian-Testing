Beside collecting and compiling resources, CRDD members are actively involved in developing new software and web services. All services developed are free for academic use. CRDD team is working hard to develop the Open Sources software in the field of chemoinformatics/pharmainformatics. CRDD team have dream that in coming years the public will have a platform from where they can contribute in the process of drug discovery. The following are a few major tools developed at CRDD.

=== Development of Databases===

*HMRBase: It is a manually curated database of Hormones and their Receptors. It is a compilation of sequence data after extensive manual literature search and from publicly available databases. HMRbase can be searched on the basis of a variety of data types. Owing to the high impact of endocrine research in the biomedical sciences, the Hmrbase could become a leading data portal for researchers. The salient features of Hmrbase are hormone-receptor pair-related information, mapping of peptide stretches on the protein sequences of hormones and receptors, Pfam domain annotations, categorical browsing options, online data submission. This database integrated in drugpedia so public can contribute.
*BIAdb:    A Database for Benzylisoquinoline Alkaloids. The Benzylisoquinoline Alkaloid Database is an attempt to gather the scattered information related to the BIA's. Many BIA's show therapeutic properties and can be considered as potent drug candidates. This database will also serve researchers working in the field of synthetic biology, as developing medicinally important alkaloids using synthetic process are one of important challenges. This database integrated in drugpedia so public can contribute.
*AntigenDB: This database contain more than 500 antigens collected from literature and other immunological resources. These antigens come from 44 important pathogenic species. In AntigenDB, a database entry contains information regarding the sequence, structure, origin, etc. of an antigen with additional information such as B and T-cell epitopes, MHC binding, function, gene-expression and post translational modifications, where available. AntigenDB also provides links to major internal and external databases.
*PolysacDB: The PolysacDB is dedicated to provide comprehensive information about antigenic polysaccharides of microbial origin (bacterial and fungal), antibodies against them, proposed epitopes, structural detail, proposed functions, assay system, cross-reactivity related information and much more. It is a manually curated database where most of data has been collected from PubMed and PubMed Central literature databases.
* TumorHope : TumorHope is a manually curated comprehensive database of experimentally characterized tumor homing peptides. These peptides recogninze tumor tissues and tumor associated micro environment, including tumor metastasis.
* ccPDB: The ccPDB database is designed to provide service to scientific community working in the field of function or structure annoation of proteins. This database of datasets is based on Protein Data Bank (PDB), where all datasets were derived from PDB. Reference Nucleic Acids Research, 2011
* OSDDchem: OSDDChem chemical database is an open repository of information on synthesised, semi-synthesized, natural and virtually designed molecules from the OSDD community.

=== Software developed ===

MycoTB: In order to assist scientific community, we extended flexible system concept for building standalone software MycoTB for Windows Users. MycoTB is one of the computer program developed under OSDD/CRDD programme. This software allow user to build their own flexible system on their personal computers to mange and annotate whole proteome of MycoTB.
