The Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, or CLEF, is an organization promoting research  in multilingual information access (currently focusing on European languages). Its specific functions are to  maintain an underlying framework for testing information retrieval systems, and creating repositories of data for researchers to use in developing  comparable standards.Carol Peters, Martin Braschler, Khalid Choukri, Julio Gonzalo, Michael Kluck, "The Future of Evaluation for Cross-Language Information Retrieval Systems" in Second Workshop of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum, CLEF 2001  pdf
The organization holds a forum meeting   every September in Europe. Prior to each forum, participants receive a set of challenge tasks. The tasks  are designed to test various aspects of information retrieval systems and encourage their development. Groups of researchers propose and organize campaigns to satisfy those tasks. The results are used as benchmarks for the state of the art  in the specific areas.
