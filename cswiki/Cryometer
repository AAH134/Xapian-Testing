A cryometer is a themometer used to measure very low temperatures of objects.
In ordinary thermometers usually mercury is used.But in cryometers usually alcohol or other low freezing point subtances are used.
Currently there are four types of devices are used as cryometers.
#thermocouples:these can be used down to measuse about 1 K temperature.
#resistance thermometers: these can be used to measure temperatures at 0.01 K.
#magnetic thermometers:which are used at 0.001 K temperatures.
#nuclear-resonance thermometers:these are required to mesure very low temperatures such as 0.0000001 K.
