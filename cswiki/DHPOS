Cash Register POS, also known as DHPOS after its creator Dale Harris, is a free Point of sale software program written in QuickBasic.

==Purpose==

DHPOS is freeware software that will convert any DOS or Windows computer into a fully functional cash register / point of sale (POS) system.
This project was originally started (2001) by Dale Harris as a way to alleviate boredom one summer and to prove to himself that he could write a better POS system than the professionally written POS software that he was forced to use in the chain store at which he worked.The Story behind DHPOS, How it was Born After completing the software he uploaded it to his website for anyone to download for free.
Interest was immediate. Soon users worldwide were downloading the software and emailing him with suggestions for new features and other ways to improve it. Many of these suggestions have been added to the software and new versions come out with new features several times a year (as of 2011).
The project continues because, according to its author, it is needed. While large corporations can afford to pay for expensive POS software many small and medium enterprises cannot. A plain cash register may be affordable for them but it will not provide the information that modern businesses must have to compete.
The current version (2011) of the software has hundreds of features that make it suitable for most small to medium enterprises. The major limitations are a maximum 26,000 different items in the stock table and a maximum of 200 lines in a sale. This would make it unsuitable for a large grocery store, bookstore, or hardware store. The software will drive receipt printers, cash drawers, pole displays , barcode readers and other POS  hardware.
As of 2011 there have been over 300,000 downloads of this software (to more than 70 countries) from the main website, and it can be also downloaded from many other freeware websites. Considering that users may  receive the program directly from others, instead of downloading it, there is no reliable way to  estimate the number of computers that are running it.
As of 2012 there is now a self checkout module for Dhpos.
