Demand-side learning is a phrase coined by Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat of Harvard Business School in the article Microsoft vs. Open Source: Who Will Win? by Sean Silverthorne from June 6, 2005. 
Demand-side learning refers to open source software's ability to be modified by the user community at large as needs and wants those who use the software at no charge, they have the incentive to modify the software and learn about how it works. Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat also suggest that regardless of the strength of Linux's demand-side learning this alone is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows.
