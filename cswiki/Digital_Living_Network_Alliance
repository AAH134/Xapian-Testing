The Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is a non-profit collaborative trade organization established by Sony in June 2003, that is responsible for defining interoperability guidelines to enable sharing of digital media between consumer devices such as computers, printers, cameras, cell phones, and other multimedia devices.  These guidelines are built upon existing public standards, but the guidelines themselves are private (available for a fee).  These guidelines specify a set of restricted ways of using the standards in order to achieve interoperability.http://gxben.wordpress.com/2008/08/24/why-do-i-hate-dlna-protocol-so-much/
DLNA uses Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) for media management, discovery and control.  UPnP defines the types of device that DLNA supports ("server", "renderer", "controller") and the mechanisms for accessing media over a network.  The DLNA guidelines then apply a layer of restrictions over the types of media file format, encodings and resolutions that a device must support.
Alliance members have stated that the common goal of using standards-based technology is to make it easier for consumers to use and share their digital photos, music and videos. As of January 2011,

==History==

Sony established the DLNA in June 2003 as the Digital Home Working Group, changing to its current name 12 months later, when the first set of guidelines for DLNA was published. Home Networked Device Interoperability Guidelines v1.5 was published in March 2006 and expanded in October of the same year; the changes included the addition of two new product categories — printers and mobile devices — as well as an "increase of DLNA Device Classes from two to twelve" and an increase in supported user scenarios related to the new product categories.

==Specification==

The DLNA Certified Device Classes are separated as follows:
Home Network Devices:
* Digital Media Server (DMS): These devices store content and make it available to networked digital media players (DMP) and digital media renderers (DMR). Examples include PCs and network-attached storage (NAS) devices.
* Digital Media Player (DMP): These devices find content on digital media servers (DMS) and provide playback and rendering capabilities. Examples include TVs, stereos and home theaters, wireless monitors and game consoles.
* Digital Media Renderer (DMR): These devices play content received from a digital media controller (DMC), which will find content from a digital media server (DMS). Examples include TVs, audio/video receivers, video displays and remote speakers for music.
** Note: it is possible for a single device (e.g. TV, A/V receiver, etc) to function both as a DMR (receives "pushed" content from DMS) and DMP ("pulls" content from DMS)
* Digital Media Controller (DMC): These devices find content on digital media servers (DMS) and play it on digital media renderers (DMR). Examples include Internet tablets, Wi-Fi enabled digital cameras and personal digital assistants (PDAs).
* Digital Media Printer (DMPr): These devices provide printing services to the DLNA home network. Generally, digital media players (DMP) and digital media controllers (DMC) with print capability can print to DMPr. Examples include networked photo printers and networked all-in-one printers
Mobile Handheld Devices
* Mobile Digital Media Server (M-DMS): These wireless devices store content and make it available to wired/wireless networked mobile digital media players (M-DMP), digital media renderers (DMR) and digital media printers (DMPr). Examples include mobile phones and portable music players.
* Mobile Digital Media Player (M-DMP): These wireless devices find and play content on a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include mobile phones and mobile media tablets designed for viewing multimedia content.
* Mobile Digital Media Uploader (M-DMU): These wireless devices send (upload) content to a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include digital cameras and mobile phones.
* Mobile Digital Media Downloader (M-DMD): These wireless devices find and store (download) content from a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include portable music players and mobile phones.
* Mobile Digital Media Controller (M-DMC): These wireless devices find content on a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS) and send it to digital media renderers (DMR). Examples include personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones.
Home Infrastructure Devices
* Mobile Network Connectivity Function (M-NCF): These devices provide a bridge between mobile handheld device network connectivity and home network connectivity.
* Media Interoperability Unit (MIU):These devices provide content transformation between required media formats for home network and mobile handheld devices.
The specification uses DTCP-IP as "link protection" for copyright-protected commercial content between one device to another.

==Member companies==

As of June 2011, there are 26 promoter members and 199 contributor members. The promoter members are: ACCESS, AT&T Labs, Awox, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Comcast, DIRECTV, Dolby Laboratories, Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, Intel, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, Panasonic, Promise Technology, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, Sharp Corporation, Sony Electronics, Technicolor, and Verizon. 
Apple Inc. is not a member. Apple uses its own Digital Audio Access Protocol instead of DLNA's UPnP protocols.
DLNA is run by a board of directors consisting of 9 members. There are 8 permanent representatives from the following companies: Broadcom, Intel, Microsoft, Nokia, Panasonic, Samsung Electronics, Sony Electronics, Technicolor and one elected representative selected by the promoter members.
The board of directors oversees the activity of the four following committees:
* Ecosystem Committee, planning the future development of DLNA guidelines
* Compliance & Test Committee, overseeing the certification program and its evolutions
* Marketing Committee, actively promoting DLNA worldwide
* Technical Committee, writing the DLNA guidelines

==Products supporting DLNA==

===DLNA-certified devices===

There are over nine thousand products on the market that are DLNA Certified. Predictions have been made as to how many DLNA Certified products are shipping:
“According to a study from ABI Research, nearly 200 million such products shipped in 2008; that number will rise to more than 300 million in 2012, and the growth curve accelerates even faster in the years that follow.”
Consumers can see if their product is certified by looking for a DLNA logo on the device or by verifying certification through the DLNA Product Search.

===DLNA technology components===

As the past president of DLNA pointed out to the Register in March 2009:http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/02/iomega_not_dlna_compliant/
"The vendors of software are allowed to claim that their software is a DLNA Technology Component if the software has gone through certification testing on a device and the device has been granted DLNA Certification. DLNA Technology Components are not marketed to the consumer but only to industry."
DLNA Interoperability Guidelines allow manufacturers to participate in the growing marketplace of networked devices and are separated into the below sections of key technology components.
* Network and Connectivity
* Device and Service Discovery and Control
* Media Format and Transport Model
* Media Management, Distribution and Control
* Digital Rights Management and Content Protection
* Manageability

===DLNA-certified software===

In early 2011, DLNA began a Software Certification program in order to make it easier for consumers to share their digital media across a broader range of products. DLNA is certifying software that is sold directly to consumers through retailers, websites and mobile application stores. With DLNA Certified software, consumers can upgrade products from within their home networks that may not be DLNA Certified and bring them into their personal DLNA ecosystems. This helps in bringing content such as videos, photos and music stored on DLNA Certified devices to a larger selection of consumer electronics, mobile and PC products.
