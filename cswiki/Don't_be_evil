Buchheit, the creator of Gmail, said he "wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take out", adding that the slogan was "also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies, especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting the users to some extent." While the official corporate philosophy of Google[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html | contribution = Corporate Information | title = Our Philosophy |publisher=Google |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25[/tpl] does not contain the words "Don't be evil", they were included in the prospectus (aka "S-1") of Google's 2004 IPO (a letter from Google's founders, later called the "'Don't Be Evil' manifesto"): "Don’t be evil.  We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served — as shareholders and in all other ways — by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains."[tpl]cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/06/23/what-would-2004-google-say-about-antitrust-probe/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first= Shira | last= Ovide | title= What Would 2004 Google Say About Antitrust Probe? | date= 2011-06-23[/tpl] The sixth point of the 10-point corporate philosophy of Google says "You can make money without doing evil."

"Don't be evil" is said to recognize that large corporations often maximize short-term profits with actions that may not be in the best interests of the public. Supposedly, by instilling a don't-be-evil culture, the corporation establishes a baseline for honest decision-making that disassociates Google from any and all cheating. This in turn can enhance the trust and image of the corporation, which may outweigh short-term gains from violating the Don't Be Evil principles.
While many companies have ethical codes to govern their conduct, Google claims to have made "Don't Be Evil" a central pillar of their identity, and part of their self-proclaimed core values.[tpl]cite web| url= http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-06-01-n17.html |title= Google Hamburg Gallery | publisher= Blogoscoped | date =2007-01-25 |accessdate=2011-11-25[/tpl] 
Criticism of Google often includes a reference to "Don't be evil".[ref]

==Avoiding conflicts of interest==

In their 2004 founders' letter[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504142742/ds1a.htm#toc59330_1 |publisher=SEC | location = USA |title= Letter from the founders, "an owner's manual" for Google's shareholders |date=14 Aug 2004[/tpl] prior to their initial public offering, Larry Page and Sergey Brin explained that their "Don't be evil" culture prohibited conflicts of interest, and required objectivity and an absence of bias:

However, he argues that clearly separating search results from sponsored links is required by law, thus, Google's practice is now mainstream and no longer remarkable or good.  According to Hoofnagle, Google should abandon the motto because:
