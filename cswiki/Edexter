eDexter is a program that helps you to use Internet filtering by acting as a local-only web server. eDexter substitutes images stored on your computer in place of images from a website.

== How it works ==

eDexter is a supplemental program that works with a hosts file. Using a hosts file to block website images leaves gaps on a website. These spaces created by not having pictures may alter the way a website displays. eDexter fills the blocked images space with a picture from your computer displayed the same size as the blocked image.  This allows a website to keep its formatting and also fills gaps that would otherwise be left by not having pictures displayed.
