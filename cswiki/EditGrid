Its Real-Time Update (RTU) feature allows multiple users to see changes on a spreadsheet immediately, and is considered a winning feature among similar products.  Its Remote Data feature can retrieve live data on the web, while its My Data Format (MDF) feature allows users to customise the output format using XSLT, such as live KML for Google Earth.  Other features include multiple access control levels, revision history[ref][tpl]pt icon[/tpl]

Apart from access from its main site, spreadsheets hosted on EditGrid can be accessed on third-party websites by means of its post-to-blog feature.
In September 2007, the EditGrid iPhone Edition was launched at the Office 2.0 Conference.
In September 2008, EditGrid launched its JavaScript Macro support, enabling user-programmed macros to manipulate EditGrid spreadsheets using JavaScript.
