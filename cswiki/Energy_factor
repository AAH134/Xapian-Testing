An energy factor is a metric used to compare energy conversion efficiencies of appliances or equipment.
For water heaters, the energy factor is the ratio of useful energy output to the total amount of energy delivered. A higher energy factor indicates greater energy efficiency.http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=water_heat.pr_crit_water_heaters
Energy factors have also been used to compare relative efficiencies of washing machines using the following formula:
Energy factor = 392 x Volume (ftÂ³) / Annual energy usage (kWh)http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=clotheswash.display_column_definitions
