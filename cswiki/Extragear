The Extragear is a collection of KDE applications that are associated with the KDE project. Those applications are not part of the main KDE software compilation, which is released regularly, but they are still part of the project. The main reason for an application to be in extragear is that it is released independently of the KDE software compilation which allows their maintainers to pursue their own development schedule. Other reasons are duplication of functionality or being very specialized (like KSMSSend).
