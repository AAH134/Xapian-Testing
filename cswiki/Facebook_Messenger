Facebook Messenger is an instant messaging service and software application which provides text and video communication. Like Facebook's web-based Chat feature, it supports the open-source XMPP protocol, connects primarily between Facebook users and synchronizes with the website.

Among its features is a "ticker" similar in function to the sidebar of friend activity seen by Facebook website users. At the time of release, "chatting with multiple friends, video calling, limiting chat availability and editing settings" were not available through the software. A Mac OS X was mentioned by Facebook developers as forthcoming.
