==History==

Figaro Systems grew out of a conversation in 1992 among three opera colleagues: Patrick Markle, at that time Technical Director of the Santa Fe Opera, Geoffrey Webb, Design Engineer for the Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, New York, and Ronald Erkman, then a technician for the Met. At that time, opera houses had two options for the display of libretto and dialogue subtitles: projection onto a large screen above the stage or onto smaller screens throughout the theatre. The translation, moreover, was in a single language.Dennis Domrzalski, "Figaro: Eyes translate when ears don't get it," New Mexico Business Weekly, Apr. 8, 2005  http://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2005/04/11/story5.html?q=Figaro%20Systems
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 had recently been enacted; Markle was trying to solve the problem of venues' lack of accessibility to patrons with disabilities, including the profoundly deaf.  Markle, Webb, and Erkman devised the first prototype of a personal seatback titling device. John Crosby of the Santa Fe Opera saw its potential for opera patrons.Figaro Systems Official Website. About Markle, Webb, and Erkman were further reinforced by their understanding of technology’s role in remediating the physical barriers people encounter, worldwide, which frustrate or prevent their access to the visual performing arts.“User-friendly art: In-seat text displays that subtitle and translate.” Auditoria, May 2007 http://figarosystems.com/linkdownloads/052007_figaro_auditoria_article.pdf
Markle, Webb, and Erkman applied for and were granted patents for their invention.United States Patent 5,739,869, "Electronic libretto display apparatus and method," issued April 14, 1998. United States Patent and Trademark Office Patent Full-Text and Image Database http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=11&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=figaro.ASNM.&OS=AN/figaro&RS=AN/FigaroLos Alamos Laboratory, Daily News Bulletin, May 7, 2001
Philanthropist and investor Alberto Vilar counted Figaro Systems among the companies in which he was a majority shareholder.Robert Hilferty, "A Knight at the Opera," New York Magazine, Jan. 14, 2002 http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/features/5616/"Alberto Vilar: The Privileges of Wealth," The Free Encyclopedia  He donated the company's electronic libretto system to European venues including The Royal Opera House in London, The La Scala's Teatro degli Arcimboldi opera houses in Milan, Italy, The Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, Spain, and The Wiener Staatsoper in Wien, Austria.Consequences of his failures to pay promised donations most of these theatres lost a lot of money.
In 2005 the Met charged the New Mexico company with unlawfully using its name in advertising promoting its " ' Simultext ' system which defendant claims can display a simultaneous translation of an opera as it occurs on a stage and that defendant represented that its system is installed at the Met." Timothy E. Eble, Class Action Litigation Information 

==Products and technology==

The company’s products are known variously as seat back titles, surtitles,Eric Skelly, "Surtitles at the Opera," Public Radio News and Information in Houston, Texas, KUHF 88.7 FM Houston Public Radio http://app1.kuhf.org/houston_public_radio-news-display.php?articles_id=20614 electronic libretto systems, opera supertitles, projected titles, and libretto translations.
Opera venues have utilized the system to display librettos in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish,"Sandia helps 278 state businesses in 2004 through New Mexico Small Business Assistance Program," Sandia National Laboratories, Sandia Corporation, March 22, 2005 http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2005/tech-trans/smbusiness.html although the software enables the reading of the libretto in any written language.“Giving the Opera a New Voice,” ''Entertainment Engineering," Volume 4, Issue 2, p. 6 http://www.entertanmentengineering.com/v4.issue04/page.06.html Translation is provided by one screen and delivery system per person.Figaro Systems Official Website
Typically, but not in all cases, the system is permanently installed along the backs of rows of seats. Each screen is positioned so that the text is clearly visible to each user. The displays were initially available in vacuum fluorescent display, (VFD) and, in 2000, liquid crystal display, (LCD) was used. In 2004 the displays became available with organic light-emitting diode, (OLED) screens.  Each type of display provides the same text information and program annotation on eight channels simultaneously, may be turned off by the user, and is user-operated with a single button. The software is capable of supporting venues’ existing systems as well as Figaro Systems' "Simultext" system. The software enables cueing of each line as it is sung, and it appears instantly on the screen.
The company builds fully modular systems including its wireless handheld screens United States Patent 6,760,010. "Wireless electronic libretto display apparatus and method," issued July 6, 2004: United States Patent and Trademark Office Patent Full-Text and Image Database http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=figaro.ASNM.&OS=AN/figaro&RS=AN/Figaro for users who cannot use seatback systems, for example people in wheelchairs, who may be viewing the opera in areas lacking seatback viewing, or people with compromised eyesight.
