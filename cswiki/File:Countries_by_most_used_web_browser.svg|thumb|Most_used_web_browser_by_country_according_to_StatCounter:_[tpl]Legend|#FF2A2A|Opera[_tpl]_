Initially, Microsoft reportedly played down the threat from Chrome and predicted that most people will embrace Internet Explorer 8. Opera Software said that "Chrome will strengthen the Web as the biggest application platform in the world".[tpl]Cite document |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/03/google-polishes-product-line-with-chrome-browser.html|title=Google polishes product line with Chrome browser |first=Michael |last=Liedtke |date=September 3, 2008|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] But by February 25, 2010, BusinessWeek had reported that "For the first time in years, energy and resources are being poured into browsers, the ubiquitous programs for accessing content on the Web. Credit for this trend—a boon to consumers—goes to two parties. The first is Google, whose big plans for the Chrome browser have shaken Microsoft out of its competitive torpor and forced the software giant to pay fresh attention to its own browser, Internet Explorer. Microsoft all but ceased efforts to enhance IE after it triumphed in the last browser war, sending Netscape to its doom. Now it's back in gear."[tpl]Cite document |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_10/b4169074693523.htm |title=Browser Wars: The Sequel |first=Rich |last=Jaroslovsky |work=BusinessWeek |date=February 25, 2010 |postscript=[/tpl] Mozilla said that Chrome's introduction into the web browser market comes as "no real surprise", that "Chrome is not aimed at competing with Firefox", and furthermore that it would not affect Google's revenue relationship with Mozilla.[tpl]cite web|url= http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/09/01/thoughts-on-chrome-more/ |title= Thoughts on Chrome & More |publisher=John's Blog |date= September 1, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite document |url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/222147/mozilla-google-is-not-trying-to-kill-us.html |title=Mozilla: Google's not trying to kill us |first=Barry |last=Collins |date=September 2, 2008 |publisher=PC Pro |postscript=[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|Chrome's design bridges the gap between desktop and so-called "cloud computing." At the touch of a button, Chrome lets you make a desktop, Start menu, or QuickLaunch shortcut to any Web page or Web application, blurring the line between what's online and what's inside your PC. For example, I created a desktop shortcut for Google Maps. When you create a shortcut for a Web application, Chrome strips away all of the toolbars and tabs from the window, leaving you with something that feels much more like a desktop application than like a Web application or page.|PC World[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/150579/google_chrome_web_browser.html |title=Google Chrome Web Browser |first=Nick |last=Mediati |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |publisher=PC World[/tpl][/tpl]
