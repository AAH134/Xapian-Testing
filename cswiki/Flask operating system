The Flask operating system architecture is a joint venture between the National Security Agency, the University of Utah, and the Secure Computing Corporation project designed to provide a framework for a more secure operating system. Development and implementation started with the Mach microkernel, and has since shifted its focus to the Linux operating system.  It is now better known as Security-Enhanced Linux (or SE Linux).
