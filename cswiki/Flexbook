Flexbook is an open-source textbook platform offered by the CK-12 Foundation. Launched in 2008, Flexbooks reduce the cost of textbooks for the K-12 market both in U.S and worldwide. Derived from the words "flexibility" and "textbook", a Flexbook allows users to produce and customize content by re-purposing educational content using different modules. Flexbooks can be designed to suit a learner’s learning style, region, language, or level of skill, while adhering to the local education standards.Creative Commons
