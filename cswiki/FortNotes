FortNotes Online Password Manager is a pay what you want password management web site based on the AES encryption in the browser developed by a developer in Ukraine.

==Overview==

After a user registration and logging in a password is set to locally encrypt/decrypt data using SJCL (Stanford Javascript Crypto Library)http://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/.
The server-side stores only an encrypted data. The registration and authentication is also anonymous.
Single piece of information in the system is called "note". There are types of notes: email, site, jabber/icq/msn/skype account, ssh/ftp. Each note consists of one or more "entries" - line of text, URI, email address or multi-line block of text.
A list of tags can be assigned to a note. There is a set of system tags. Tags are used to perform server-side searching. Client-side additional filtration is available after a search.
