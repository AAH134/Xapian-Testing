== History ==

In June 2009 Albert Molina, Xavier Gassó and Abel Parera prepared, from the Telecentre of Berga, the first free software conference in this town. After this conference they thought that a street in Berga could be named Free Software Street (Carrer del Programari Lliure, in Catalan), so they asked for it to the Town Council of Berga.
In January 2010, the second edition of the conferences about free software were being prepared and it was decided to invite Richard Stallman to participate in them and in the opening of the street, as well. A part from that, finally the contacts with the politicians in the Town Council were successful and on 10 June 2010 the municipality decided to name a street in Berga "Carrer del Programari Lliure" (Free Software Street).
On 3 July the major of Berga, Juli Gendrau, and Richard Stallman inaugurated the street.
