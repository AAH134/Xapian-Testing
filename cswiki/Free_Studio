DVDVideoSoft project was launched in 2006. The founders distributed paid software as an affiliate at the beginning, however, some time later their own products appeared on the site. The first program, Free YouTube Download, immediately became popular among YouTube admirers. This success inspired DVDVideoSoft and they created more YouTube applications. Later on upon users' requests DVDVideoSoft started developing other kinds of applications. Today DVDVideoSoft updates its software and releases new products in many respects due to the lively discussion and users' comments on DVDVideoSoft forum page.
