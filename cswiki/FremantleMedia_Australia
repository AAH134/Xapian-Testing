FremantleMedia Australia is the Australian arm of FremantleMedia and was formed in 2006 by the merger of two great names in Australian television industry - Crackerjack Productions and Grundy Television, who had been both acquired by FremantleMedia.
Primary creator and producer of original comedy programming in Australia, Crackerjack was a renowned boutique production company operating since the early 90s. Its successes include Comedy Inc., The Chaser Decides, So Fresh, Australia's Brainiest Kid and The Biggest Loser Australia.
Grundy was founded by Reg Grundy, its first production being Wheel of Fortune in 1959. From its small beginnings it became the largest privately owned Australian producer and distributor of television programmes both domestically and internationally.
Grundy's first success in the serial drama genre came during the 1970s with favourites The Young Doctors, The Restless Years, Sons And Daughters and Prisoner, which grew into a worldwide cult hit. Aired on Network Ten since 1986, Neighbours continues to prove a hit, ranking No. 1 in its time slot for key young adult target groups. Neighbours was the highest rated daytime drama series in the UK in 2007, with audiences over 3 million viewers. Neighbours moved to broadcaster Channel Five in the UK in February 2008 and is the highest rated daytime show for the broadcaster.
