Fully Automatic Installation (FAI) is a non-interactive system
to install the Debian computer operating system and other
distributions https://lists.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/linux-fai/2011-September/009243.html CentOS and Scientific Linux Cern installations with FAI  unattended on a single computer or a whole cluster.
FAI uses a collection of Perl and shell scripts for the installation process. Changes to the configuration files of the operating system can be made by cfengine, shell, Perl and expect scripts.
There is a PHP based graphical frontend GOsa (not only) for FAI, which is used by the City of Munich at their migration to LinuxCity of Munich report.
FAI is released under GNU GPL 2+.
