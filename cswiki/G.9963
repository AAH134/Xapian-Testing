Recommendation G.9963 is a home networking standard under development at the International Telecommunication Union standards sector, the ITU-T.
It was begun in 2010 by ITU-T to add multiple-input and multiple-output (known as MIMO) capabilities to the G.hn standard originally defined in Recommendation G.9960. The standard is also known as "G.hn-mimo".[tpl]cite web |title = G.9963 (ex G.hn-MIMO) |work= ITU-T Work Programme |url= http://www.itu.int/itu-t/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=7726  |accessdate= July 27, 2011 [/tpl]
