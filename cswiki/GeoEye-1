GeoEye-1 is a high-resolution earth observation satellite owned by GeoEye, which was launched in September 2008.

==History==

On December 1, 2004, General Dynamics C4 Systems announced it had been awarded a contract worth approximately $209 million to build the OrbView-5 satellite. Its sensor is designed by the ITT Exelis.
The satellite, now known as GeoEye-1, was originally scheduled for April 2008 but lost its 30-day launch slot to a U.S. government mission which had been delayed.  It was rescheduled for launch August 22, 2008  from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta II launch vehicle.  It was delayed again to September 6 because Hurricane Hanna interfered with its launch crews.
The launch took place successfully on September 6, 2008 at 11:50:57 a.m. PDT (18:50:57 UTC). The GeoEye-1 satellite separated successfully from its Delta II launch vehicle at 12:49 p.m. PDT (19:49 UTC), 58 minutes and 56 seconds after launch.

GeoEye-1 provides  and an inclination of 98 degrees, with a 10:30 a.m. equator crossing time. GeoEye-1 can image up to 60 degrees off nadir. It is operated out of Dulles, Virginia.
At the time of its launch, GeoEye-1 was the world’s highest resolution commercial earth-imaging satellite.

=== 2009 Anomaly ===

In December 2009 GeoEye announced it had suspended imagery collections by GeoEye-1 for a few days, citing an irregularity in the downlink antenna. "The irregularity appears to limit the range of movement of GeoEye-1's downlink antenna, which may in turn affect GeoEye-1's ability to image and downlink simultaneously," GeoEye said.
