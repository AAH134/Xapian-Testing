GeoEye-1 is a high-resolution earth observation satellite owned by GeoEye, which was launched in September 2008.

==History==

On December 1, 2004, General Dynamics C4 Systems announced it had been awarded a contract worth approximately $209 million to build the OrbView-5 satellite.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gdc4s.com/news/detail.cfm?prid=14 |title=General Dynamics to Build Satellite to Improve U.S. Government Access to High-Resolution Earth Imagery |publisher=GD[/tpl] Its sensor is designed by the ITT Exelis.
The satellite, now known as GeoEye-1, was originally scheduled for April 2008 but lost its 30-day launch slot to a U.S. government mission which had been delayed.  It was rescheduled for launch August 22, 2008  from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a Delta II launch vehicle.[tpl]cite web |url=http://launch.geoeye.com/LaunchSite/about/launch_details.aspx |title=GeoEye-1 Launch Details |publisher=GeoEye[/tpl] The launch was postponed to September 4, 2008, due to unavailability of the Big Crow telemetry-relay aircraft.Restatement Pulls GeoEye's Goals Back Down to Earth[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/delta/d335/080812delay.html |title=Delta 2 rocket launch of GeoEye craft postponed |accessdate=2008-08-14 |author=Justin Ray[/tpl]  It was delayed again to September 6 because Hurricane Hanna interfered with its launch crews.
The launch took place successfully on September 6, 2008 at 11:50:57 a.m. PDT (18:50:57 UTC). The GeoEye-1 satellite separated successfully from its Delta II launch vehicle at 12:49 p.m. PDT (19:49 UTC), 58 minutes and 56 seconds after launch.[tpl]cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/delta/d335/status.html |title=Delta 2-335 Mission Status Center |accessdate=2008-09-05 |author=Justin Ray[/tpl]

==Specifications and operation==

GeoEye-1 provides [tpl]convert|0.41|m|in|abbr=on[/tpl] panchromatic and [tpl]convert|1.65|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] multispectral imagery in [tpl]convert|15.2|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] swaths. The spacecraft is intended for a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of [tpl]convert|684|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] and an inclination of 98 degrees, with a 10:30 a.m. equator crossing time. GeoEye-1 can image up to 60 degrees off nadir. It is operated out of Dulles, Virginia.
At the time of its launch, GeoEye-1 was the world’s highest resolution commercial earth-imaging satellite.[tpl]cite web |url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/84635-geoeye-1-launch-continues-on-track |title=GeoEye-1 Launch Continues On Track |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=2008-07-11[/tpl] GeoEye-1 was manufactured in Gilbert, Arizona by General Dynamics and launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The first image was returned on October 7, of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania.[tpl] cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/10/geoeye-1-super.html|title=Google's Super Satellite Captures First Image|publisher=Wired|date=2008-10-07[/tpl]
Google, which has its logo on the side of the rocket, has exclusive online mapping use of its data. While GeoEye-1 is capable of imagery with details the size of [tpl]convert|41|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], that resolution will only be available to the US government. Google will have access to details of [tpl]convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. Prior maximum commercial imagery was [tpl]convert|60|cm|in[/tpl].Google to buy GeoEye satellite imagery -cnet.com - August 29, 2008
The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and Google both paid $502 million for the satellite and upgrades to GeoEye's four ground stations.http://gizmodo.com/5060853/google-geoeye+1-satellite-takes-first-pic-is-that-your-house

=== 2009 Anomaly ===

In December 2009 GeoEye announced it had suspended imagery collections by GeoEye-1 for a few days, citing an irregularity in the downlink antenna. "The irregularity appears to limit the range of movement of GeoEye-1's downlink antenna, which may in turn affect GeoEye-1's ability to image and downlink simultaneously," GeoEye said.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSGE5BG0HJ20091217?type=marketsNews |title=GeoEye says satellite glitch could hit 2010 revenue |publisher=Reuters |date=Dec 17, 2009[/tpl]
