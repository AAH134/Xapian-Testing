GlobaLeaks is an open source sofware system intended to enable anonymous whistle-blowing.

==History==

A prototype was announced on 6 September 2011

==Model==

Globaleaks does not publish to the public. The organization invites anyone to install their software on their own computers, thus making it a node in a distributed private anonymous network. Whereas Wikileaks uses a centralized data distribution system similar Napster's, Globaleaks uses a shared download distribution system similar to BitTorrent's.

==Operation==

A GlobaLeaks node utilizes Tor Hidden Services and Tor2web.

==Organization==

GlobaLeaks is an independent organization made up of a globally distributed group of software developers.
