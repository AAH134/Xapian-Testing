==Model==

Globaleaks does not publish to the public. The organization invites anyone to install their software on their own computers, thus making it a node in a distributed private anonymous network. Whereas Wikileaks uses a centralized data distribution system similar Napster's, Globaleaks uses a shared download distribution system similar to BitTorrent's.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/01/26/globaleaks-wants-to-be-the-bittorrent-to-wikileaks-napster/ |title=GlobaLeaks Wants To Be The Bittorrent To WikiLeaks' Napster |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |work=Forbes |year=26 January 2011|accessdate=21 January 2012[/tpl]

==Operation==
