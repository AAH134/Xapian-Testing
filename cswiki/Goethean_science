Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, although primarily known as a literary figure, did research in morphology, anatomy, and optics, and also developed a phenomenological approach to science and to knowledge in general.
In his 1792 essay "The experiment as mediator between subject and object", Goethe developed an original philosophy of science, which he used in his research. The essay underscores his experiential standpoint. "The human being himself, to the extent that he makes sound use of his senses, is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist."[tpl]cite journal | last = Goethe | first = Johann | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = Douglas | title = Scientific Studies (Goethe: The Collected Works, Vol. 12), p.57 | publisher = Princeton University Press | month = October |  year = 1995[/tpl]
His scientific works include his 1790 Metamorphosis of Plants and his 1810 book Theory of Colors. His work in optics, and his polemics against the reigning Newtonian theory of optics, were poorly received by the scientific establishment of his time.
Arthur Schopenhauer expanded on Goethe's research in optics using a different methodology in his On Vision and Colors.
Rudolf Steiner presents Goethe's approach to science as phenomenological in the Kürschner edition of Goethe's writings.[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2011|Which Kürschner edition is exactly meant?[/tpl] Steiner elaborated on this in the books Goethean Science (1883)Rudolf Steiner, Goethean Science.

Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception (1886).e-text in which he emphasizes the need of the perceiving organ of intuition in order to grasp Goethe's biological archetype (i.e. The Typus).
Steiner's branch of Goethean Science was extended by Oskar Schmiedel and Wilhelm Pelikan, who did research using Steiner's interpretations.
Ludwig Wittgenstein's discussions of Goethe's Theory of Colors were published as Bemerkungen über die Farben (Remarks on Color)Bemerkungen über die Farben , ed. by G.E.M. Anscombe (1977) Remarks on Colour ISBN 0-520-03727-8. Remarks on Goethe's Theory of Colours.
Goethe's vision of holistic science inspired biologist and paranormal researcher Rupert Sheldrake. He went to an Anglican boarding school and then took biology at Cambridge, studying "life" by killing animals and then grinding them up to extract their DNA. This was troubling. Rescue came when a friend turned him on to Goethe. This old German's 18th century vision of "holistic science" appealed to the young Brit very much. Sheldrake used Goethe to investigate how the lilies of the field actually become lilies of the field."Rupert Sheldrake: The delightful crackpot" by David Bowman, Salon.com American philosopher Walter Kaufmann argued that Freud's psychoanalysis was a "poetic science" in Goethe's sense.Walter Arnold Kaufmann Goethe, Kant, and Hegel: Discovering the Mind Transaction Publishers, 1991 ISBN 0-88738-370-X, ISBN 978-0-88738-370-0 http://books.google.com/books?id=iDIs2uDBaW4C&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22poetic+science%22+goethe&source=bl&ots=5WHy9uOGZM&sig=J9LG5TARzIQH_yilQxfjlGscYJM&hl=en&ei=5BwgS6usBs-JnQefpMzWDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22poetic%20science%22%20goethe&f=false[ref]

Biologist Brian Goodwin (1931-2009) in his book How the Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of Complexity claimed that organisms as dynamic systems are the primary agents of creative evolutionary adaptation, in the book Goodwin stated: "The ideas I am developing in this book are very much in the Goethean spirit."How the Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of Complexity, Brian Goodwin, Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 123 ISBN 0-691-08809-8
