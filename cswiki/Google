=== Financing and initial public offering ===

The first funding for Google was an August 1998 contribution of [tpl]US$|100,000[/tpl] from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, given before Google was even incorporated.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/29/MNGLD6CFND34.DTL|title=For early Googlers, key word is $$$|last=Kopytoff|first=Verne|date=April 29, 2004|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Communications|accessdate=February 19, 2010|location=San Francisco[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] Early in 1999, while still graduate students, Brin and Page decided that the search engine they had developed was taking up too much of their time from academic pursuits. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer, and later criticized Vinod Khosla, one of Excite's venture capitalists, after he had negotiated Brin and Page down to $750,000. On June 7, 1999, a $25 million round of funding was announced,[tpl]Cite press release|url=http://google.com/pressrel/pressrelease1.html|archiveurl=http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease1.html |archivedate=March 9, 2000 |title=Google Receives $25 Million in Equity Funding |date=June 7, 1999 |location=Palo Alto, Calif. |publisher=Google |accessdate=February 16, 2009[/tpl] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital.

In order to maintain an uncluttered page design and increase speed, advertisements were solely text-based. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bids and click-throughs, with bidding starting at five cents per click. This model of selling keyword advertising was first pioneered by Goto.com, an Idealab spin-off created by Bill Gross.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/2166331|title=GoTo Going Strong|last=Sullivan|first=Danny|date=July 1, 1998|newspaper=SearchEngineWatch.com|publisher=Incisive Interactive Marketing|accessdate=February 18, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Pay-for-placement-gets-another-shot/2100-1023_3-208309.html|title=Pay-for-placement gets another shot|last=Pelline|first=Jeff|date=February 19, 1998|newspaper=CNET News|publisher=CNET|accessdate=February 18, 2010[/tpl] When the company changed names to Overture Services, it sued Google over alleged infringements of the company's pay-per-click and bidding patents.

=== Advertising ===

Ninety-nine percent of Google's revenue is derived from its advertising programs.Google Annual Report, Feb. 15, 2008 For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312507044494/d10k.htm|title=Form 10-K – Annual Report|accessdate=July 5, 2010|publisher=SEC|work=EDGAR[/tpl] Google has implemented various innovations in the online advertising market that helped make it one of the biggest brokers in the market. Using technology from the company DoubleClick, Google can determine user interests and target advertisements so they are relevant to their context and the user that is viewing them.[tpl]Cite news|author=Nakashima, Ellen |title=Some Web Firms Say They Track Behavior Without Explicit Consent |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081102270_pf.html |date=August 12, 2008 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 5, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |author=Helft, Miguel|title=Google to Offer Ads Based on Interests |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/technology/internet/11google.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 11, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |accessdate=July 5, 2010[/tpl] Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.[tpl]Cite news |author=Bright, Peter |title=Surfing on the sly with IE8's new "InPrivate" Internet |url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/08/surfing-on-the-sly-ie8s-inprivate-internet.ars |date=August 27, 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |accessdate=September 1, 2008[/tpl] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google's AdWords allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through either a cost-per-click or cost-per-view scheme. The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website, and earn money every time ads are clicked.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/login/en_US/?sourceid=aso&subid=uk-en-ha&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=adsense&gsessionid=O---pJlnnf2wFZF8qu81Lg |title=AdSense |accessdate=October 11, 2009[/tpl]
One of the disadvantages and criticisms of this program is Google's inability to combat click fraud, when a person or automated script "clicks" on advertisements without being interested in the product, which causes that advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claim that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were in fact fraudulent or invalid.Mills, Elinor. "Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats." c net. July 25, 2006. Retrieved July 29, 2006. Furthermore, there has been controversy over Google's "search within a search", where a secondary search box enables the user to find what they are looking for within a particular website. It was soon reported that when performing a search within a search for a specific company, advertisements from competing and rival companies often showed up along with those results, drawing users away from the site they were originally searching.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.searchengineoptimizationjournal.com/2008/03/24/why-companies-are-upset-about-googles-search-within-search/ |title=Why Companies Are Upset With Google's Search-Within-Search |author=Stamoulis, Nick |publisher=Search Engine Optimization Journal |date=March 24, 2008[/tpl] Another complaint against Google's advertising is its censorship of advertisers, though many cases concern compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. For example, in February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of Oceana, a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating "Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations."[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban|title= Google Somewhat Lifts Oceana Ad Ban|publisher=webpronews.com[/tpl] The policy was later changed.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/Terms.html|title= Google AdSense Online Standard Terms and Conditions |publisher=Google AdSense[/tpl] In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized due to antitrust concerns by the U.S. Department of Justice. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/10/31/yahoo-and-google-may-dump-their-deal/print/ |title=Yahoo and Google may dump their deal|last= Mclntyre|first=Douglas |publisher=Bloggingstocks.com |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/ending-our-agreement-with-yahoo.html |title=Ending our agreement with Yahoo!|last= Drummond|first=David|date= November 5, 2008 |work=The Official Google Blog.

One of the more controversial search services Google hosts is Google Books. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books where allowed, into its new book search engine. The Authors Guild, a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this new service.

=== Productivity tools ===

In addition to its standard web search services, Google has released over the years a number of online productivity tools. Gmail, a free webmail service provided by Google, was launched as an invitation-only beta program on April 1, 2004, and became available to the general public on February 7, 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/02/anyone-can-signup-for-gmail-account.html |title=More People Can Sign up for a Gmail Account |last=Chitu |first=Ionut Alex. |date=February 7, 2007 |publisher=Google Operating System Blog |accessdate=April 3, 2010[/tpl] The service was upgraded from beta status on July 7, 2009,[tpl]cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-apps-is-out-of-beta-yes-really.html |title=Google Apps is out of beta (yes, really) |first=Matthew |last=Glotzbach |date=July 7, 2009 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=April 2, 2010[/tpl] at which time it had 146 million users monthly.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/articles/news/facebook-strikes-back-at-google-integrates-its-chat-with-aol-instant-messenger-20100211/ |title=Facebook strikes back at Google, integrates its chat with AOL Instant Messenger |first=Christian |last=Zibreg |date=February 11, 2010 |work=Geek.com |publisher=Geek.com, LLC |at=para. 5 |accessdate=April 2, 2010 |quote=While Gmail's 146 million monthly users are no match for Facebook’s 400+ million-strong user base, not all of them use built-in chat.[/tpl] The service would be the first online email service with one gigabyte of storage, and the first to keep emails from the same conversation together in one thread, similar to an Internet forum.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/04/01/cashmore.gmail/ |title=Six ways Gmail revolutionized e-mail |first=Pete |last=Cashmore |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=CNN News |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |location=London, England |accessdate=April 2, 2010[/tpl] The service currently offers over 7600 MB of free storage with additional storage ranging from 20 GB to 16 TB available for [tpl]US$|0.25[/tpl] per 1 GB per year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/twice-storage-for-quarter-of-price.html |title=Twice the storage for a quarter of the price |last=Lee |first=Elvin |date=November 10, 2009 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=April 3, 2010[/tpl] Furthermore, software developers know Gmail for its pioneering use of AJAX, a programming technique that allows web pages to be interactive without refreshing the browser.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/happy-sixth-birthday-google-mail--680998 |title=Happy sixth birthday, Google Mail! |first=Gary |last=Marshall |date=April 1, 2010 |work=TechRadar |publisher=Future Publishing Ltd. |accessdate=April 3, 2010[/tpl] One criticism of Gmail has been the potential for data disclosure, a risk associated with many online web applications.

Google Docs, another part of Google's productivity suite, allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in an online environment, not dissimilar to Microsoft Word.

=== Enterprise products ===

Google entered the enterprise market in February 2002 with the launch of its Google Search Appliance, targeted toward providing search technology for larger organizations. Google launched the Mini three years later, which was targeted at smaller organizations. Late in 2006, Google began to sell Custom Search Business Edition, providing customers with an advertising-free window into Google.com's index. The service was renamed Google Site Search in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://searchengineland.com/google-rebrands-custom-search-business-edition-as-google-site-search-14123 |title=Google Rebrands Custom Search "Business Edition" As "Google Site Search" |last1=Sterling |first1=Greg |date=June 3, 2008 |work=Search Engine Land |publisher=Third Door Media |accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl]
Google Apps is another primary Google enterprise service offering. The service allows organizations to bring Google's web application offerings, such as Gmail and Google Docs, into its own domain. The service is available in several editions: a basic free edition (formerly known as Google Apps Standard edition), Google Apps for Business, Google Apps for Education, and Google Apps for Government.  Special editions include extras such as more disk space, API access, a service level agreement (SLA), premium support, and additional apps.  In the same year Google Apps was launched, Google acquired Postini[tpl]cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/weve-officially-acquired-postini.html |title=We've Officially Acquired Postini |last1=Girouard |first1=Dave |date=September 13, 2007 |work=The Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl] and proceeded to integrate the company's security technologies into Google Apps[tpl]Cite press release |title=Google Adds Postini's Security and Compliance Capabilities to Google Apps |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=October 3, 2007 |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/apps_postini_20071003.html |accessdate=June 15, 2010[/tpl] under the name Google Postini Services.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/security/index.html |title=Postini |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl]
Additional Google enterprise offerings include geospatial solutions (e.g., Google Earth and Google Maps); security and archival solutions (e.g., Postini), and Chromebooks for business and education (i.e., personal computing run on browser-centric operating systems).

=== Other products ===

Google Translate is a server-side machine translation service, which can translate between 35 different languages. Browser extensions allow for easy access to Google Translate from the browser.

In 2006, Google made a bid to offer free wireless broadband access throughout the city of San Francisco along with Internet service provider EarthLink. Large telecommunications companies such as Comcast and Verizon opposed such efforts, claiming it was "unfair competition" and that cities would be violating their commitments to offer local monopolies to these companies. In his testimony before Congress on network neutrality in 2006, Google's Chief Internet Evangelist Vint Cerf blamed such tactics on the fact that nearly half of all consumers lack meaningful choice in broadband providers.[tpl]Cite news |first=Hannibal |last=Travis |title=Wi-Fi Everywhere: Universal Broadband Access as Antitrust and Telecommunications Policy |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=903425 |work=American University Law Review, vol. 55, p. 1701 |publisher=President and Trustees of American University in Washington, DC | year=2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2010[/tpl] Google currently offers free wi-fi access in its hometown of Mountain View, California.[tpl]cite web |url=http://wifi.google.com/ |title=Google WiFi for Mountain View |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl]

=== Googleplex ===

Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as "the Googleplex", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a complex of buildings. The lobby is decorated with a piano, lava lamps, old server clusters, and a projection of search queries on the wall. The hallways are full of exercise balls and bicycles. Each employee has access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted video games, table football, a baby grand piano, a billiard table, and ping pong. In addition to the rec room, there are snack rooms stocked with various foods and drinks, with special emphasis placed on nutrition."About the Googleplex." Google. Retrieved March 5, 2008. Free food is available to employees 24/7, with paid vending machines prorated favoring nutritional value.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.theatlantic.com/life/print/2011/07/what-googles-famous-cafeterias-can-teach-us-about-health/241876/ | title = What Google's Famous Cafeterias Can Teach Us About Health | date = July, 2011 | accessdate =July 14, 2011 [/tpl]
In 2006, Google moved into [tpl]convert|311000|sqft|m2|-2[/tpl] of office space in New York City, at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.Reardon, Marguerite. "Google takes a bigger bite of Big Apple." c net. October 2, 2006. Retrieved October 9, 2006. The office was specially designed and built for Google, and it now houses its largest advertising sales team, which has been instrumental in securing large partnerships. In 2003, they added an engineering staff in New York City, which has been responsible for more than 100 engineering projects, including Google Maps, Google Spreadsheets, and others. It is estimated that the building costs Google $10 million per year to rent and is similar in design and functionality to its Mountain View headquarters, including table football, air hockey, and ping-pong tables, as well as a video game area. In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/technology/10346550/detail.html | title = Google Completes Pittsburgh Office, Holds Open House | date = November 17, 2006 | accessdate =January 13, 2008 | work=WTAE ThePittsburghChannel [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_712700.html |title=Google search: Tech-minded workers |last=Olson |first=Thomas |date=December 8, 2010 |publisher=Trib Total Media |accessdate=December 8, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] By late 2006, Google also established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/webdev/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=202600809| title=Inside Google's Michigan Office| date=October 24, 2007| publisher=InformationWeek[/tpl] Furthermore, Google has offices all around the world, and in the United States, including Ann Arbor, Michigan; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; New York City; San Francisco, California; Seattle, Washington; Reston, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.
Google is taking steps to ensure that its operations are environmentally sound. In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 megawatts of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.Richmond, Riva. "Google plans to build huge solar energy system for headquarters." MarketWatch. October 17, 2006. Retrieved October 17, 2006. The system will be the largest solar power system constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world. In addition, Google announced in 2009 that it was deploying herds of goats to keep grassland around the Googleplex short, helping to prevent the threat from seasonal bush fires while also reducing the carbon footprint of mowing the extensive grounds.[tpl]cite web| url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/mowing-with-goats.html | title=Official Google Blog: Mowing with goats| date=May 1, 2009| publisher=Google[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/04/AR2009050400027.html | work=The Washington Post | title=My Day With The Google Goats | first=MG | last=Siegler | date=May 3, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010[/tpl] The idea of trimming lawns using goats originated from R.

=== Easter eggs and April Fools' Day jokes ===

Google has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. For example, Google MentalPlex allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/mentalplex/ |title=Google MentalPlex |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010[/tpl] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/tisp/ |title=Welcome to Google TiSP |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010[/tpl] Also in 2007, Google's Gmail page displayed an announcement for Gmail Paper, allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |title=Google Paper |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010[/tpl]

In 2010, Google jokingly changed its company name to Topeka in honor of Topeka, Kansas, whose mayor actually changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its new Google Fiber Project.[tpl]cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html |title=A different kind of company name |last1=Schmidt |first1=Eric |date=April 1, 2010 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/01/business/main6353136.shtml |title=April Fools: Google Changes Name to Topeka |date=April 1, 2010 |work=CBS News |publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010[/tpl] In 2011, Google announced Gmail Motion, an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/216708/technology/googles-gmail-motion-launched-april-1 |title=Google's GMail Motion launched April 1 |date=April 1, 2011 |work=GMA News |publisher=GMA News [/tpl]
In addition to April Fools' Day jokes, Google's services contain a number of Easter eggs. For instance, Google included the Swedish Chef's "Bork bork bork," Pig Latin, "Hacker" or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/language_tools |title=Language Tools |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] In addition, the search engine calculator provides the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything from Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything |title=Google Search Results for 'answer to life the universe and everything' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010[/tpl] Furthermore, when searching the word "recursion", the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=recursion |title=Google Search Results for 'recursion' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010[/tpl] Likewise, when searching for the word "anagram," meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=anagram |title=anagram search |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=Sep 22, 2010[/tpl] In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to "kayak across the Pacific Ocean." During FIFA World Cup 2010, search queries like "World Cup", "FIFA", etc. caused the "Goooo...gle" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read "Goooo...al!" instead.[tpl]cite web | url=http://asia.cnet.com/crave/google-celebrates-world-cup-with-gooooooooooal-62111461.htm | title=Google celebrates World Cup with Gooooooooooal! | publisher=CNET Asia | date=June 9, 2010 | accessdate=May 18, 2011 | author=Chan, John[/tpl] Typing in 'Do a barrel roll' in the search engine will make the page do a 360° rotation.

=== Network neutrality ===

Google is a noted supporter of network neutrality. According to Google's Guide to Net Neutrality:
 Network neutrality is the principle that Internet users should be in control of what content they view and what applications they use on the Internet. The Internet has operated according to this neutrality principle since its earliest days... Fundamentally, net neutrality is about equal access to the Internet. In our view, the broadband carriers should not be permitted to use their market power to discriminate against competing applications or content. Just as telephone companies are not permitted to tell consumers who they can call or what they can say, broadband carriers should not be allowed to use their market power to control activity online.[tpl]cite web |url=http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/search/label/Net%20Neutrality |publisher=Google Public Policy Blog |title=Time to let the process unfold |date=October 22, 2009 |author=Richard Whitt |accessdate=December 20, 2009 [/tpl]
On February 7, 2006, Vint Cerf, a co-inventor of the Internet Protocol (IP), and current Vice President and "Chief Internet Evangelist" at Google, in testimony before Congress, said, "allowing broadband carriers to control what people see and do online would fundamentally undermine the principles that have made the Internet such a success."[tpl]cite web|author=Cerf, Vinton|authorlink=Vint Cerf|title=The Testimony of Mr. Vinton Cerf, Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist, Google|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1937&wit_id=5416|accessdate=May 4, 2008|format=PDF|page=8|date=February 7, 2006[/tpl]

=== Privacy ===

Eric Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, said in a 2007 interview with the Financial Times: "The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as ‘What shall I do tomorrow?’ and ‘What job shall I take?'".Google’s goal: to organise your daily life Financial Times Schmidt reaffirmed this 2010 in an interview with the Wall Street Journal: "I actually think most people don't want Google to answer their questions, they want Google to tell them what they should be doing next."Google and the Search for the Future Wall Street Journal
On December 2009, Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, declared after privacy concerns: "If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. If you really need that kind of privacy, the reality is that search engines – including Google – do retain this information for some time and it's important, for example, that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/07/schmidt_on_privacy/|title=Google chief: Only miscreants worry about net privacy|last=Cade|first=Metz |date=December 7, 2009 |work=The Register|accessdate=January 5, 2010[/tpl] Privacy International ranked Google as "Hostile to Privacy", its lowest rating on its report, making Google the only company in the list to receive that ranking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/internet/interimrankings.pdf |title=Privacy International 2007 Consulation Report |format=PDF |accessdate=October 26, 2010[/tpl]Google ranked 'worst' on privacy BBC News, June 2007Delichatsios, Stefanie Alki; Sonuyi, Temitope, "Get to Know Google...Because They Know You", MIT, Ethics and Law on the Electronic Frontier, 6.805, December 14, 2005
At the Techonomy conference in 2010 Eric Schmidt predicted that "true transparency and no anonymity" is the way forward for the internet: "In a world of asynchronous threats it is too dangerous for there not to be some way to identify you. We need a verified name service for people. Governments will demand it." He also said that "If I look at enough of your messaging and your location, and use artificial intelligence, we can predict where you are going to go. Show us 14 photos of yourself and we can identify who you are. You think you don't have 14 photos of yourself on the internet? You've got Facebook photos!"[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/8/5/no-anonymity-future-web-says-google-ceo/ |title=No anonymity on future web says Google CEO |publisher=THINQ.co.uk |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |date=August 5, 2010[/tpl]

Despite being highly influential in local and national public policy, Google does not disclose its political spending online. In August 2010, New York City Public Advocate Bill de Blasio launched a national campaign urging the corporation to disclose all of its political spending.[tpl]cite web |url=http://advocate.nyc.gov/google |title=Google: Disclose Now! |last1=Bill de Blasio |first1=Office of the Public Advocate for the City of New York |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010[/tpl]
During 2006–2010 Google Streetview camera cars collected about 600 gigabytes of data from users of unencrypted public and private Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries. No disclosures nor privacy policy was given to those affected, nor to the owners of the Wi-Fi stations. A Google representative claimed that the company was not aware of its own data collection activities until an inquiry from German regulators was received, and that none of this data was used in Google's search engine or other services. A representative of Consumer Watchdog replied, "Once again, Google has demonstrated a lack of concern for privacy. Its computer engineers run amok, push the envelope and gather whatever data they can until their fingers are caught in the cookie jar." In a sign that legal penalties may result, Google said it will not destroy the data until permitted by regulators.[tpl]cite web|author=Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writer |url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Google-grabs-personal-info-apf-2162289993.html?x=0 |title=Google grabs personal info off of Wi-Fi networks |publisher=Finance.yahoo.com |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8684110.stm | title=Google admits wi-fi data blunder | date=May 15, 2010 |publisher=BBC News | first=Maggie | last=Shiels[/tpl]
