==Applications==

YouTube and Blogger maintain their own accounts for users that registered with the services before Google bought them.

Users with a Google account can create a publicly accessible Google profile, which they can use to control how they are presented on Google products to other Google users.  A Google profile can be linked to a user's profiles on various social-networking and image-hosting sites, as well as user blogs.

== Blocking accounts ==

Google may block an account for various reasons, such as "unusual activity" or entering an age "not old enough" to own a Google account. Reactivation is possible using web-forms, providing proof of identity through valid photo ID, or a small credit card payment (at a cost of 0.30 USD). Other methods (such as sending a fax or uploading some requested document) require human interaction and may take some "days or a couple of weeks" to be accomplished.

==Security==

Google accounts can be protected by enhanced security known as “two-step verification”.[tpl]cite web|last=Fallows|first=James|title=Hacked|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/hacked/8673/?single_page=true|publisher=Atlantic Monthly|accessdate=26 December 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64EGXxTPF|archivedate=26 December 2011|quote=As email, documents, and almost every aspect of our professional and personal lives moves onto the “cloud”—remote servers we rely on to store, guard, and make available all of our data whenever and from wherever we want them, all the time and into eternity—a brush with disaster reminds the author and his wife just how vulnerable those data can be. A trip to the inner fortress of Gmail, where Google developers recovered six years’ worth of hacked and deleted e‑mail, provides specific advice on protecting and backing up data now—and gives a picture both consoling and unsettling of the vulnerabilities we can all expect to face in the future.[/tpl]
