Google China is a subsidiary of Google, Inc., the world's largest Internet search engine company. Google China ranks as the number 2 search engine in the People's Republic of China, after Baidu. In 2010, searching via all Google search sites, including Google Mobile, were moved from Mainland China to Hong Kong.

== History ==

Google China was founded in 2005 and was originally headed by Kai-Fu Lee, a former Microsoft executive and the founder in 1998 of Microsoft Research Asia.[tpl]cite news|last=Donnelly |first=Laura |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6143553/China-Google-boss-departure-reignites-debate-over-censorship.html |title=China Google boss departure reignites debate over censorship |publisher=Telegraph |date=September 5, 2009 |accessdate=March 30, 2010 | location=London[/tpl]  Microsoft sued Google and Kai-Fu Lee for the move, but reached a confidential settlement.CNET News.com: Microsoft settles with Google over executive hire (December 22, 2005) Google's Beijing based office was initially located at NCI Tower.   
In 2005, a Chinese-language interface was developed for the google.com website. In Jan 2006, Google launched its China-based google.cn search page with results subject to censorship by the Chinese government. 
The Beijing office was moved to Tsinghua Science Park in early 2006. The newest office has been in use since September 2006. It is a 10-floor building located in Tsinghua Science Park, near the south gate of Tsinghua University.
In Mar 2009, China blocked access to Google's YouTube site; access to other Google online services is denied to users on an ad hoc basis. 
On September 4, 2009, after four years leading Google China, Kai-Fu Lee announced his surprise departure to start a venture fund amid debate about the Chinese government's censorship policies and Google's decreasing share to rival Baidu.  

===Ending of self-censorship===

In Jan 2010, Google announced that in response to a Chinese-originated hacking attack on them and other US tech companies, they were no longer willing to censor searches in China and would pull out of the country completely if necessary.[ref]

On March 23, 2010 at 3 am Hong Kong Time (UTC+8), Google started to redirect all search queries from Google.cn to Google.com.hk.

David Drummond, senior vice president of Google, stated in the official Google blog that the current circumstances surrounding censorship of the Internet in Mainland China led Google to make such a decision. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region in China with a comparably higher level of freedom of speech and expression, and google.com.hk does not censor search results, making it more effective for networking and sharing information with Internet users in mainland China.Google.cn has been redirected to google.com.hk, Easy SEO Solution Google's internet mail service, Gmail, is available to mainland China users.

On March 30, 2010, searching via all Google search sites (not only google.cn but all language versions, e.g. google.co.jp. google.com.au, etc.), including Google Mobile, was banned in Mainland China. Any attempt to search using Google resulted in a DNS error. Other Google services such as Google Mail and Google Maps appeared to be unaffected. Xiao Qiang, director of the China Internet Project at UC Berkeley and founder of the China Digital Times, noted that the ban in mainland China could eventually block all access to Google sites and applications if the Chinese Government wanted.
The ban was lifted the day after.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/prc/info.html |title=Web search, Images and News 3/30/10 availability |publisher=Google |date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

== Controversies ==

Before Google China's establishment, Google.com itself was accessible, even though much of its content was not accessible because of censorship. According to official statistics, google.com was accessible 90% of the time, and a number of services were not available at all.Official Google Blog: Google in China, January 27, 2006
Since announcing its intent to comply with Internet censorship laws in the People's Republic of China, Google China had been the focus of controversy over what critics view as capitulation to the "Golden Shield Project". Because of its self-imposed censorship, whenever people searched for prohibited Chinese keywords on a blocked list maintained by the PRC government, google.cn displayed the following at the bottom of the page (translated): In accordance with local laws, regulations and policies, part of the search result is not shown. Some searches, such as (as of June 2009) "Tank Man" were blocked entirely, with only the message "Search results may not comply with the relevant laws, regulations and policy, and can not be displayed" appearing.
Google argued that it could play a role more useful to the cause of free speech by participating in China's IT industry than by refusing to comply and being denied admission to the mainland Chinese market. "While removing search results is inconsistent with Google's mission, providing no information (or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information) is more inconsistent with our mission," a statement said.BBC News  "Google censors itself for China."   January 25, 2006

=== Operation Aurora ===

On January 12, 2010, Google announced that it was "no longer willing to continue censoring" results on Google.cn, citing a breach of Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. The company found that the hackers had breached two Gmail accounts but were only able to access 'from' and 'to' information and subject headers of emails in these accounts.[tpl]cite news|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/01/12/business/1247466517265/google-may-close-operations-in-china.html|title=CNBC Video: Interview With Google's Chief Legal Officer | work=The New York Times | accessdate=April 9, 2010[/tpl] The company's investigation into the attack showed that at least 34 other companies had been similarly targeted. Among the companies that were attacked were Adobe Systems, Symantec, Yahoo, Northrop Grumman and Dow Chemical. Experts claim the aim of the attacks was to gain information on weapon systems, political dissidents, and valuable source code that powers software applications.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011300359.html |title=Google China cyberattack part of vast espionage campaign, experts say |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=March 30, 2010 | date=January 14, 2010[/tpl] Additionally, dozens of Gmail accounts in China, Europe, and the United States had been regularly accessed by third parties, by way of phishing or malware on the users' computers rather than a security breach at Google. Although Google did not explicitly accuse the Chinese government of the breach, it said it was no longer willing to censor results on google.cn, and that it will discuss over the next few weeks "the basis on which we could run an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China."[tpl]cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html|title=Official Google Blog: A new approach to China|publisher=Google|date=January 12, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8455712.stm|title=Google 'may end China operations over Gmail breaches'|publisher=BBC|date=January 12, 2010|Google 'may pull out of China after Gmail cyber attack'|accessdate=January 12, 2010[/tpl] Google.cn transiently turned off its search result filtering. However, the filtering was later re-enabled without any acknowledgment or explanation; search queries in Chinese on the keywords Tiananmen or June 4, 1989 returned censored results with the standard censorship footnote.a Google.CN search
On January 13, 2010, the news agency AHN reported that the U.S. Congress plans to investigate Google's allegations that the Chinese government used the company's service to spy on human rights activists.

The Chinese government has since made numerous standard and general statements on the matter, but has taken no real actions. It also criticized Google for failing to provide any evidence of its accusation. Accusations were made by Baidu, a competing Chinese search engine, that Google was pulling out for financial rather than humanitarian reasons. Baidu is the market leader in China with about 60% of the market share compared to Google's 31%, Yahoo placing third with less than 10%.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8455712.stm|title=Google 'may pull out of China after Gmail cyber attack'|date=January 13, 2010 |work=BBC News[/tpl] People's Daily published a scathing op-ed on Google which criticized western leaders for politicizing the way in which China controls citizen's access to the Internet, saying "implementing monitoring according to a country's national context is what any government has to do," and that China's need to censor the internet is greater than that of developed countries, "The Chinese society has generally less information bearing capacity than developed countries such as the U.S. ..."[tpl]cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90780/91344/6873383.html |title=Google, do not take Chinese netizens hostage |work=People's Daily, January 19, 2010[/tpl]

==In media==

According to Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science from City University of Hong Kong, the ruling Chinese Communist Party was deploying Chinese nationalism to stifle debate about censorship.[ref]
</ref> By criticizing cultural export (in this case, the [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] of Google in China), it provides defense to justify the Chinese authorities' censorship control.<ref name="reuters" />
The Chinese authorities are accused of steering state-run media to bundle Google together with other recent disputes with United States that have stirred nationalist rancour in China. On the website of the Global Times (www.huanqiu.com) such examples are found, one user wrote "Get the hell out" while another one wrote "Ha ha, I'm going to buy firecrackers to celebrate!".
According to Isaac Mao, a prominent Chinese internet expert, maybe 90% of Internet users in China do not care whether Google leaves or not. Among Chinese users who strongly support Google remaining in China without censorship (or leaving China to keep its neutrality and independence), many are accustomed to using circumvention technology to access blocked websites.[ref]
