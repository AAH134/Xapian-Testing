Google Chrome is a freeware web browser developed by Google that uses the WebKit layout engine. It was first released as a beta version for Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2008, and the public stable release was on December 11, 2008. , Google Chrome has approximately 33% worldwide usage share of web browsers, making it the most widely used web browser, according to StatCounter.Top 5 Browsers, from week 20 2011 to week 20 2012.
In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium.

==History==

For six years, Google's Chief Executive Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser. He stated that "At the time, Google was a small company", and he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars". However, after co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind".

===Announcement===

The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features within the new browser. and mentioned it on their official blog along with an explanation for the early release.

===Public release===

The browser was first publicly released for Microsoft Windows (XP and later versions) on September 2, 2008 in 43 languages, officially a beta version.
In early January 2009, CNET reported that Google planned to release versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux in the first half of the year. saying they were missing many features and were intended for early feedback rather than general use.
In December 2009, Google released beta versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux.
Chrome was one of the twelve browsers offered to European Economic Area users of Microsoft Windows in 2010.

===Development===

Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as Mozilla's Netscape Portable Runtime, Network Security Services, NPAPI, as well as SQLite and a number of other open-source projects. The V8 JavaScript virtual machine was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was Adobe/Mozilla's Tamarin) and handled by a separate team in Denmark coordinated by Lars Bak at Aarhus. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but web applications such as Gmail "are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to DOM manipulations and JavaScript", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.
Chrome uses the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages, on advice from the Android team. Chrome is tested internally with unit testing, "automated user interface testing of scripted user actions", fuzz testing, as well as WebKit's layout tests (99% of which Chrome is claimed to have passed) and against commonly accessed websites inside the Google index within 20–30 minutes.
Google created Gears for Chrome, which added features for web developers typically relating to the building of web applications, including offline support. However, Google phased out Gears in favor of HTML5.
On January 11, 2011 the Chrome Product manager, Mike Jazayeri, announced that Chrome will no longer support H.264 video codec for its HTML5 player, citing the desire to bring Google Chrome more inline with the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on. As of January 2012, there has been no announcement yet of which future version of Chrome will actually implement the removal of H.264 support.
On February 7, 2012, Google launched Google Chrome Beta for Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) devices.
In March 2012 Google announced it was working on a version of Chrome for both the Metro and desktop versions of Windows 8.

====Enterprise deployment====

In December 2010 Google announced that to make deploying Chrome easier in a business environment they would provide an official Chrome MSI package. For Enterprise deployments it's important to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files, but the provided MSI is only a very limiting MSI wrapper around the normal installer that does not fulfill all Enterprise needs.

====Chromium====

In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium. This move enabled third-party developers to study the underlying source code and to help port the browser to the Mac OS X and Linux operating systems. The Google-authored portion of Chromium is released under the permissive BSD license.

==Features==

Google Chrome aims to be secure, fast, simple

===Web standards support===

The first release of Google Chrome passed both the Acid1 and Acid2 tests. Beginning with version 4.0, Chrome has passed all aspects of the Acid3 test.
On Ecma International's ECMAScript standards conformance Test 262 (version ES5.1 of 2012-05-18), Chrome version 19.0.1084.52 scored 26/11570. The beta version 20.0.1132.21 scored 17/11570. The dev version 21.0.1163.0 scored 17/11570. For comparison, Internet Explorer has a score of 600+. Lower scores are better, as the figure represents the number of failed tests out of the total number of tests.
On the official CSS 2.1 test suite by standardization organization W3C, WebKit, the Chrome rendering engine, passes 89.75% (89.38% out of 99.59%) of covered CSS 2.1 tests.
On the HTML5 test (April, 2012 – version 3.0), Chrome version 19.0.1084.52 scored 402 out of 500, with 13 bonus points. The beta version 20.0.1132.34 scored 444 out of 500, with 13 bonus points. The dev version 21.0.1163.0 scored 442 out of 500, with 13 bonus points.

===Security===

Chrome periodically retrieves updates of two blacklists (one for phishing and one for malware), and warns users when they attempt to visit a harmful site. This service is also made available for use by others via a free public API called "Google Safe Browsing API".
Chrome will typically allocate each tab to fit into its own process to "prevent malware from installing itself" and prevent what happens in one tab from affecting what happens in another; however, the actual process-allocation model is more complex.
Typically, plugins such as Adobe Flash Player are not standardized and as such, cannot be sandboxed as tabs can be. These often must run at, or above, the security level of the browser itself. To reduce exposure to attack, plugins are run in separate processes that communicate with the renderer, itself operating at "very low privileges" in dedicated per-tab processes. Plugins will need to be modified to operate within this software architecture while following the principle of least privilege. Chrome supports the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI),

====Security vulnerabilities====

No security vulnerabilities in Chrome had been successfully exploited in the three years of Pwn2Own from 2009–11.Gregg Keizer, Google's Chrome untouched at Pwn2Own hack match, Computerworld, March 10, 2011
However, Chrome was the first browser to be defeated at Pwn2Own 2012, by a French team who used zero day exploits to take complete control of a fully patched 64-bit Windows 7 PC using a booby-trapped website that overcame Chrome's sandboxing. It was also compromised twice at the 2012 CanSecWest Pwnium.
Google's official response to the vulnerabilities was delivered by Jason Kersey, who congratulated the researchers, noting "We also believe that both submissions are works of art and deserve wider sharing and recognition."

====Malware blocking====

A study has shown that users are four times more likely to be tricked into downloading malware than be compromised by an exploit.

===Privacy===

====Privacy mode====

The private browsing feature called Incognito mode prevents the browser from permanently storing any history information or cookies from the websites visited. Incognito mode is similar to the private browsing feature in other web browsers.  Chrome was the second browser to implement this feature, after Safari.

====Usage tracking====

Chrome sends details about its usage to Google through both optional and non-optional user tracking mechanisms.
Some of the tracking mechanisms can be optionally enabled and disabled through the installation interface and through the browser's options dialog. Unofficial builds, such as SRWare Iron and CoolNovo (previously known as ChromePlus), seek to remove these features from the browser altogether. The RLZ feature is not included in the Chromium browser either.
In March 2010, Google devised a new method to collect installation statistics: the unique ID token included with Chrome is now only used for the first connection that Google Update makes to its server.
Concern about Chrome's optional usage collection and tracking have been noted in several publications.
The optional suggestion service included in Google Chrome has been criticized because it provides the information typed into the Omnibox to the search provider before the user even hits return. This allows the search engine to provide URL suggestions, but also provides them with web usage information tied to an IP address. The feature can be selected off in the preferences-under the hood/bonnet-privacy box.

====Do Not Track====

In February 2012, Google announced that Chrome will support Do Not Track by the end of 2012.

===Speed===

The JavaScript virtual machine used by Chrome, the V8 JavaScript engine, has features such as dynamic code generation, hidden class transitions, and precise garbage collection.
Several websites performed benchmark tests using the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark tool as well as Google's own set of computationally intense benchmarks, which include ray tracing and constraint solving.
On September 3, 2008, Mozilla responded by stating that their own TraceMonkey JavaScript engine (then in beta), was faster than Chrome's V8 engine in some tests.
Two weeks after Chrome's launch, the WebKit team announced a new JavaScript engine, SquirrelFish Extreme,
Chrome uses DNS prefetching to speed up website lookups,
Chrome utilizes the faster, SPDY protocol instead of HTTP

===Stability===

A multi-process architecture is implemented in Chrome
Chrome includes a process management utility called Task Manager which lets users see what sites and plugins are using the most memory, downloading the most bytes and overusing the CPU and provides the ability to terminate them.

===User interface===

By default, the main user interface includes back, forward, refresh/cancel and menu buttons. A home button is not shown by default, but can be added through the Settings page to take the user to the new tab page or a custom home page.
Tabs are the main component of Chrome's user interface and as such, have been moved to the top of the window rather than below the controls. This subtle change contrasts with many existing tabbed browsers which are based on windows and contain tabs. Tabs, with their state, can be transferred seamlessly between window containers by dragging. Each tab has its own set of controls, including the Omnibox.
The Omnibox is a URL box that combines the functions of both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing Tab to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before – powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also autocomplete the URLs of sites visited often. If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.
When Google Chrome is not maximized, the tab bar appears directly under the title bar. When maximized, the tabs become flush with the top of the title bar. Like other browsers, it has a full-screen mode that hides the operating system and browser interface.
One of Chrome's differentiating features is the New Tab Page, which can replace the browser home page and is displayed when a new tab is created. Originally, this showed thumbnails of the nine most visited web sites, along with frequent searches, recent bookmarks, and recently closed tabs; similar to Internet Explorer and Firefox with Google Toolbar, or Opera's Speed Dial. In Google Chrome 2.0, the New Tab Page was updated to allow users to hide thumbnails they did not want to appear.
Starting in version 3.0, the New Tab Page was revamped to display thumbnails of the eight most visited web sites. The thumbnails could be rearranged, pinned, and removed. Alternatively, a list of text links could be displayed instead of thumbnails. It also features a "Recently closed" bar that shows recently closed tabs and a "tips" section that displays hints and tricks for using the browser.

Chrome includes a bookmark manager that can be opened from a menu. Adding the command-line option: --bookmark-menu adds a bookmarks button to the right of the Omnibox that can be used in place of the bookmarks bar.
Popup windows are associated with the tab they came from and will not appear outside the tab unless the user explicitly drags them out.
Google Chrome's "Settings" page has four sections:
*Basic includes options for the home page, search engine, and default browser.
*Personal Stuff lets users configure and manage their synchronized data, saved passwords, form autofill, browsing data, and themes.
*Under the Hood allows changing network, privacy, download, and security settings.
*Extensions, available since Chrome 15, allows users to install, remove, manage, and update Chrome's wide variety of browser extensions.
Like Firefox, Chrome does not have a status bar, but displays loading activity and hover-over information via a status bubble that pops up at the bottom left of the relevant page, excluding hovering over links in image maps.
For web developers, Chrome features an element inspector similar to the one in Firebug.
Chrome has special URLs that load application-specific pages instead of websites or files on disk. Chrome also has a built-in ability to enable experimental features. Originally called about:labs, the address was changed to about:flags to make it less obvious to casual users.
In March 2011, Google introduced a new simplified logo to replace the previous 3D logo that had been used since the project's inception. Google designer Steve Rura explained the company reasoning for the change, "Since Chrome is all about making your web experience as easy and clutter-free as possible, we refreshed the Chrome icon to better represent these sentiments. A simpler icon embodies the Chrome spirit – to make the web quicker, lighter, and easier for all."

===Desktop shortcuts and apps===

Chrome allows users to make local desktop shortcuts that open web applications in the browser. The browser, when opened in this way, contains none of the regular interface except for the title bar, so as not to "interrupt anything the user is trying to do". This allows web applications to run alongside local software (similar to Mozilla Prism and Fluid).
This feature, according to Google, will be enhanced with the Chrome Web Store, a one-stop web-based web applications directory which opened in December 2010.

====Chrome Web Store====

Announced on December 7, 2010, the Chrome Web Store allows users to install web applications as extensions to the browser, although most of these function simply as links to popular web pages and/or games, but some of the apps like Springpad do provide extra features like offline access. The themes and extensions have also been tightly integrated into the new store, allowing users to search the entire catalog of Chrome extras.
The Chrome Web Store was opened on February 11, 2011 with the release of Google Chrome 9.0.

===Extensions===

On September 9, 2009, Google enabled extensions by default on Chrome's Dev channel, and provided several sample extensions for testing.
Along with Google Chrome 4.0, the extension gallery was officially launched on January 25, 2010, containing over 1500 extensions.
As of February 4, 2011, the extension gallery featured more than 11,500 extensions,
Many Chrome extensions, once installed, have access to the user's data. There are three levels of permissions that an app or extension may request.

===Themes===

Starting with Google Chrome 3.0, users can install themes to alter the appearance of the browser. accessible through a "Get themes" button in Chrome's options.Basic settings: Change browser theme Google Chrome Help

===Automatic web page translation===

Starting with Google Chrome 4.1 the application added a built-in translation bar using Google Translate. Translation is currently available for 52 languages.

===Release channels and updates===

On January 8, 2009 Google introduced a new release system with three distinct channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the "Dev" channel). Before this change there were only two channels: Beta and Developer preview. All previous Developer channel users were moved to the Beta channel. The reason given by Google is that the Developer channel builds are less stable and polished than those that Developer channel users were getting during Google Chrome's Beta period. The stable channel will be updated with features and fixes once they have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel will be updated roughly monthly with stable and complete features from the Developer channel.
The Developer channel is where ideas get tested (and sometimes fail) and can be very unstable at times.
Chrome automatically keeps itself up to date. The details differ by platform.
On Windows, it uses Google Updater, and autoupdate can be controlled via Group Policy, On Linux, it lets the system's normal package management system supply the updates.

===Retina screen support===

Google announced in its Chrome blog that it will bring high resolution Retina support to Apple's next generation MacBook Pro. Google’s Chrome engineers already have a version of the browser ready to handle the 2880 × 1800 high-resolution screen. “We’re committed to polishing Chrome until it shines on new Pro” the Chrome team wrote, releasing an early version of the browser ( 22 Canary) with basic Retina support, and promising more soon.

==Platforms==

Chrome is available for
* Windows: XP Service Pack 2+ / Vista / 7
* Mac OS X: 10.5.6 or later, Intel processors (not PowerPC)
* Linux: Ubuntu 8.04 or later / Debian 5 / OpenSuse 11.1 / Fedora
As of 2012, 32-bit and 64-bit builds are available for Linux, with only 32-bit builds available for Mac OS X and Windows.

===Android version===

A beta version for Android 4.0 devices was launched on February 7, 2012, available for a limited number of countries from Google Play.
* Notable features: Synchronization with desktop Chrome to provide the same bookmarks and view the same browser tabs, Hardware acceleration
* Many of the latest HTML5 features: almost all of the Web Platform’s features: GPU-accelerated canvas, including CSS 3D Transforms, CSS animations, SVG, WebSockets (including binary messages), Dedicated Workers; it has overflow scroll support, strong HTML5 video support, and new capabilities such as IndexedDB, WebWorkers, Application Cache and the File APIs, date and time pickers, parts of the Media Capture API. Also supports mobile oriented features such as Device Orientation and Geolocation.
* Mobile customisations: Swipe gesture tab switching, Link Preview allows zooming in on (multiple) links to ensure the desired one is clicked, Font size boosting to ensure readability regardless of the zoom level
* Missing from the desktop version: sandboxed tabs, Adobe Flash (now and in future), WebGL, Native Client
* Development changes: Remote debugging, part of the browser layer has been implemented in Java, communicating with the rest of the Chromium and WebKit code through Java Native Bindings. The code of Chrome for Android is a fork of the Chromium project. It is a priority to upstream most new and modified code to Chromium and WebKit to resolve the fork
* April 17, 2012 update included the availability to access in 31 additional languages and in all countries where Google Play is available. A desktop version of a website can also be requested as opposed to a mobile version. In addition, Android users can now add bookmarks to their Android home screens if they choose and decide which apps should handle links opened in Chrome.Ardinois, Frederic (April 17, 2012), Chrome For Android Gets Desktop View, Home Screen Bookmarks, File Downloads

===Chrome OS===

Google Chrome is the basis of Google's Chrome OS operating system that ships on specific hardware from Google's manufacturing partners.
Google announced Chrome OS on July 7, 2009.

===Metro version===

On June 2012, Google released the developers version of Chrome 21.  On Windows 8, this version of Chrome can be run in the Metro UI as long as it is set as the default browser on the computer. The Metro version of Chrome looks identical to its desktop counterpart and does not support the standard design principles of the Metro UI.

==Usage==
