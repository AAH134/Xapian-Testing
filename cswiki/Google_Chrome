Google Chrome is a freeware web browser developed by Google that uses the WebKit layout engine. It was first released as a beta version for Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2008, and the public stable release was on December 11, 2008. [tpl]as of|2012|01|alt=As of May 2012[/tpl], Google Chrome has approximately 33% worldwide usage share of web browsers, making it the most widely used web browser, according to StatCounter.Top 5 Browsers, from week 20 2011 to week 20 2012.
In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium.[tpl]cite web|url= http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/09/google-unveils-chrome-source-code-and-linux-port.ars |title= Google unveils Chrome source code and Linux port |author=Ryan Paul |publisher=Ars Technica |date= September 2, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl]"Google Chrome is built with open source code from Chromium."

==History==

For six years, Google's Chief Executive Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser. He stated that "At the time, Google was a small company", and he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars". However, after co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind".[tpl]cite web |author=Julia Angwin |date=July 9, 2009 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/07/09/sun-valley-schmidt-didnt-want-to-build-chrome-initially-he-says/ |title=Sun Valley: Schmidt Didn't Want to Build Chrome Initially, He Says |work=WSJ Digits Blog |accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl]

===Announcement===

The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features within the new browser.[tpl]cite web |author=Scott McCloud |date=September 1, 2008 |url=http://smccloud.livejournal.com/15488.html |title=Surprise! |work=Google Blogoscoped |accessdate=September 1, 2008[/tpl] Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and German blogger Philipp Lenssen of Google Blogoscoped[tpl]cite web |author=Philipp Lenssen |date=September 1, 2008 |title=Google Chrome, Google's Browser Project |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-09-01-n47.html |accessdate=September 1, 2008 [/tpl] made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008.[tpl]cite web |author=Philipp Lenssen |date=September 1, 2008 |title=Google on Google Chrome – comic book |url=http://blogoscoped.com/google-chrome/ |work=Google Blogoscoped |accessdate=September 1, 2008[/tpl] Google subsequently made the comic available on Google Books[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/|title=Google Chrome comic|work=Google Book Search|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=September 2, 2008[/tpl] and mentioned it on their official blog along with an explanation for the early release.

===Public release===

The browser was first publicly released for Microsoft Windows (XP and later versions) on September 2, 2008 in 43 languages, officially a beta version.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.doeswhat.com/2008/09/02/it-was-when-not-if-google-chrome/ |title=It was when not if...

In early January 2009, CNET reported that Google planned to release versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux in the first half of the year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/chrome-gets-mac-deadline-extensions-foundation/|title=Chrome gets Mac deadline, extensions foundation|last=Shankland|first=Stephen|date=January 9, 2009|publisher=CNET|accessdate=January 13, 2009[/tpl] The first official Chrome Mac OS X and Linux developer previews[tpl]cite web|url=http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel |title=Early Access Release Channels |publisher=Dev.chromium.org |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] were announced on June 4, 2009 with a blog post[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.chromium.org/2009/06/danger-mac-and-linux-builds-available.html |title=Danger: Mac and Linux builds available |accessdate=June 9, 2009[/tpl] saying they were missing many features and were intended for early feedback rather than general use.
In December 2009, Google released beta versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux.[tpl]cite web|url= http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2009/12/beta-update-linux-mac-and-windows.html |title= Beta Update: Linux, Mac, and Windows |author=Mark Larson |publisher=Google |date=December 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-chrome-for-holidays-mac-linux.html |title=Google Chrome for the holidays: Mac, Linux and extensions in beta |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] Google Chrome 5.0, announced on May 25, 2010, was the first stable release to support all three platforms.[tpl]cite web|url= http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/05/new-chrome-stable-release-welcome-mac.html |title= A new Chrome stable release: Welcome, Mac and Linux! |publisher=Google |author=Brian Rakowski |date= May 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl]
Chrome was one of the twelve browsers offered to European Economic Area users of Microsoft Windows in 2010.[tpl]cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8537763.stm |title= Microsoft offers browser choices to Europeans |publisher=BBC News |date= March 1, 2010 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl]

===Development===

Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as Mozilla's Netscape Portable Runtime, Network Security Services, NPAPI, as well as SQLite and a number of other open-source projects.[tpl]cite web|url= http://catonmat.net/blog/code-reuse-in-google-chrome-browser/ |title= Code reuse in Google Chrome Browser |author=Peteris Krumins |date= September 5, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] The V8 JavaScript virtual machine was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was Adobe/Mozilla's Tamarin) and handled by a separate team in Denmark coordinated by Lars Bak at Aarhus. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but web applications such as Gmail "are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to DOM manipulations and JavaScript", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.
Chrome uses the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages, on advice from the Android team. Chrome is tested internally with unit testing, "automated user interface testing of scripted user actions", fuzz testing, as well as WebKit's layout tests (99% of which Chrome is claimed to have passed) and against commonly accessed websites inside the Google index within 20–30 minutes.
Google created Gears for Chrome, which added features for web developers typically relating to the building of web applications, including offline support. However, Google phased out Gears in favor of HTML5.[tpl]cite web |url= http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/hello-html5.html |title= Hello HTML5 |publisher=Google |author=Ian Fette |date= February 19, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl]
On January 11, 2011 the Chrome Product manager, Mike Jazayeri, announced that Chrome will no longer support H.264 video codec for its HTML5 player, citing the desire to bring Google Chrome more inline with the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html |title=HTML Video Codec Support in Chrome |publisher=Blog.chromium.org |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] As of January 2012, there has been no announcement yet of which future version of Chrome will actually implement the removal of H.264 support.
On February 7, 2012, Google launched Google Chrome Beta for Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) devices.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/07/google-chrome-browser-arrives-on-android-video/|title=Google Chrome Beta arrives on Android|publisher=Engadget[/tpl]
In March 2012 Google announced it was working on a version of Chrome for both the Metro and desktop versions of Windows 8.[tpl]cite news |url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/12/chrome-windows-8/|title=Google Confirms It’s Working on Chrome for Windows 8 |last=Pachal |first=Peter |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012[/tpl]

====Enterprise deployment====

In December 2010 Google announced that to make deploying Chrome easier in a business environment they would provide an official Chrome MSI package. For Enterprise deployments it's important to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files, but the provided MSI is only a very limiting MSI wrapper around the normal installer that does not fulfill all Enterprise needs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=68519 |title=Change MSI from a wrapper to "full" MSI |publisher=Google |date=January 4, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's local app data directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process[tpl]Cite news|url = http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/12/google-offering-msi-to-simplify-chrome-enterprise-deployment.ars|title = Google offering MSI to simplify Chrome enterprise deployment|accessdate =December 16, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan |year = 2010|month = December| work=Ars Technica[/tpl] – it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using Google Pack. Google also created Group Policies to fine tune the behavior of Chrome in the business environment, for example setting automatic updates interval, disable auto updates, a home page and to workaround their basic Windows design flaws and bugs if it comes to roaming profiles support, etc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=146164 |title=Google Update for Enterprise – Google Help |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] Until version 18 the software is known not to be ready for Enterprise deployments with roaming profiles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=2423 |title=Issue 2423 – chromium – Windows Roaming Profile support – An open-source browser project to help move the web forward. – Google Project Hosting |publisher=Google |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl]

====Chromium====

In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium. This move enabled third-party developers to study the underlying source code and to help port the browser to the Mac OS X and Linux operating systems. The Google-authored portion of Chromium is released under the permissive BSD license.[tpl]cite web|title=Home (Chromium Developer Documentation)|url=http://dev.chromium.org/Home|accessdate=May 5, 2009|publisher=dev.chromium.org|year=2009|work=Chromium Developer Documentation[/tpl] Other portions of the source code are subject to a variety of open source licenses.[tpl]cite web |url=http://code.google.com/chromium/terms.html |title=Chromium Terms and Conditions |date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008 |work=Google Code[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl] Chromium implements a similar feature set as Chrome, but lacks built-in automatic updates, built-in PDF reader and built-in Flash player, as well as Google branding and has a blue-colored logo instead of the multicolored Google logo.

==Features==

Google Chrome aims to be secure, fast, simple[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html|title=Technology overview – Google chrome[/tpl] and stable. There are extensive differences from its peers in Chrome's minimalistic user interface, which is atypical of modern web browsers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.glosonblog.com/google-chromes-unique-features/ |title= Google Chrome's Unique Features |author=Gloson |date= December 4, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] For example, Chrome does not render RSS feeds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=84 |title=Issue 84 – chromium – RSS or Atom support needed – An open-source browser project to help move the web forward. – Google Project Hosting |publisher=Google |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] Chrome's strength is its application performance and JavaScript processing speed, both of which were independently verified by multiple websites to be the swiftest among the major browsers of its time.[tpl]cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10030888-92.html |title= Speed test: Google Chrome beats Firefox, IE, Safari – Business Tech |author=Stephen Shankland |publisher=CNET News |date=September 2, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5286869/lifehacker-speed-tests-safari-4-chrome-2-and-more |title= Lifehacker Speed Tests: Safari 4, Chrome 2, and More – Browsers |author=Kevin Purdy |publisher=Lifehacker |date= June 11, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] Many of Chrome's unique features had been previously announced by other browser developers, but Google was the first to implement and publicly release them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techstroke.com/12-unique-features-of-chrome-fast-and-powerful-web-browser-from-google.html |title=12 Unique features of Chrome|publisher=TechStroke |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] For example, its most prominent graphical user interface (GUI) innovation, the merging of the address bar and search bar (the Omnibox), was first announced by Mozilla in May 2008 as a planned feature for Firefox.[tpl]cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9944662-2.html |title= The future of the Firefox address bar |author=Rafe Needleman |publisher=CNET News |date= May 14, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl]

===Web standards support===

The first release of Google Chrome passed both the Acid1 and Acid2 tests. Beginning with version 4.0, Chrome has passed all aspects of the Acid3 test.[tpl]cite web|url= http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/01/stable-channel-update_25.html|title= Stable Channel Update |publisher=Google |author=Anthony Laforge |accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl]

The beta version 20.0.1132.21 scored 17/11570. The dev version 21.0.1163.0 scored 17/11570. For comparison, Internet Explorer has a score of 600+. Lower scores are better, as the figure represents the number of failed tests out of the total number of tests.
On the official CSS 2.1 test suite by standardization organization W3C, WebKit, the Chrome rendering engine, passes 89.75% (89.38% out of 99.59%) of covered CSS 2.1 tests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS2.1/20110323/reports/results.html|title=CSS 2.1 Test Suite RC6 Results|accessdate=May 6, 2011|publisher=W3C[/tpl]
On the HTML5 test (April, 2012 – version 3.0),[tpl]cite web|url=http://html5test.com/|title=HTML5 test|accessdate=April 3, 2012|publisher=Chrome[/tpl] Chrome version 19.0.1084.52 scored 402 out of 500, with 13 bonus points.

===Security===

Chrome periodically retrieves updates of two blacklists (one for phishing and one for malware), and warns users when they attempt to visit a harmful site. This service is also made available for use by others via a free public API called "Google Safe Browsing API".
Chrome will typically allocate each tab to fit into its own process to "prevent malware from installing itself" and prevent what happens in one tab from affecting what happens in another; however, the actual process-allocation model is more complex.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.marcchung.com/2008/09/05/chromes-process-model-explained.html |title=chromes-process model explained |first=Marc |last=Chung |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2008[/tpl] Following the principle of least privilege, each process is stripped of its rights and can compute, but cannot write files or read from sensitive areas (e.g. documents, desktop)—this is similar to the "Protected Mode" used by Internet Explorer on Windows Vista and Windows 7. The Sandbox Team is said to have "taken this existing process boundary and made it into a jail";[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamesforthebrain.com/google-chrome/26|title=Google Chrome|author=Google|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=September 3, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl] for example, malicious software running in one tab is supposed to be unable to sniff credit card numbers entered in another tab, interact with mouse inputs, or tell Windows to "run an executable on start-up" and it will be terminated when the tab is closed. This enforces a simple computer security model whereby there are two levels of multilevel security (user and sandbox) and the sandbox can only respond to communication requests initiated by the user.[tpl]cite web|first=Adam|last=Barth|coauthors=Collin Jackson, Charles Reis, and The Google Chrome Team|title=The Security Architecture of the Chromium Browser |publisher=Stanford Security Laboratory|url=http://crypto.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/chromium-security-architecture.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=September 11, 2008[/tpl] On Linux sandboxing uses the seccomp mode.[tpl]cite web|author=Markus Gutschke|title=Re: PATCH 2/2 x86-64: seccomp: fix 32/64 syscall hole|url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.sparc/11622|date=May 6, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Jake Edge|title=Google's Chromium sandbox|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/347547/|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2011[/tpl]
Typically, plugins such as Adobe Flash Player are not standardized and as such, cannot be sandboxed as tabs can be. These often must run at, or above, the security level of the browser itself. To reduce exposure to attack, plugins are run in separate processes that communicate with the renderer, itself operating at "very low privileges" in dedicated per-tab processes. Plugins will need to be modified to operate within this software architecture while following the principle of least privilege. Chrome supports the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface (NPAPI),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/webmasters-faq.html#activex |title=Google Chrome FAQ for web developers|publisher=Google |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] but does not support the embedding of ActiveX controls.

====Security vulnerabilities====

No security vulnerabilities in Chrome had been successfully exploited in the three years of Pwn2Own from 2009–11.Gregg Keizer, Google's Chrome untouched at Pwn2Own hack match, Computerworld, March 10, 2011
However, Chrome was the first browser to be defeated at Pwn2Own 2012, by a French team who used zero day exploits to take complete control of a fully patched 64-bit Windows 7 PC using a booby-trapped website that overcame Chrome's sandboxing. It was also compromised twice at the 2012 CanSecWest Pwnium.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/pwn2own-2012-google-chrome-browser-sandbox-first-to-fall/10588 |title=Pwn2Own 2012: Google Chrome browser sandbox first to fall |publisher=Zdnet.com |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/cansecwest-pwnium-google-chrome-hacked-with-sandbox-bypass/10563 |title=CanSecWest Pwnium: Google Chrome hacked with sandbox bypass |publisher=Zdnet.com |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/teenager-hacks-google-chrome-with-three-0day-vulnerabilities/10649 |title=Teenager hacks Google Chrome with three 0day vulnerabilities |publisher=Zdnet.com |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl]
Google's official response to the vulnerabilities was delivered by Jason Kersey, who congratulated the researchers, noting "We also believe that both submissions are works of art and deserve wider sharing and recognition."[tpl]cite web|url = http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/03/chrome-stable-update_10.html|title = Chrome Stable Update|accessdate =March 10, 2012|last = Kersey|first = Jason |date = March 10, 2012[/tpl]

====Malware blocking====

A study has shown that users are four times more likely to be tricked into downloading malware than be compromised by an exploit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virusbtn.com/conference/vb2010/abstracts/Hughes.xml|title=Virus Bulletin : 2010 – Social engineering trumps a zero-day every time |publisher=AVG Technologies |first=Brian|last=Hughes|accessdate=July 21, 2011[/tpl] A May 2011 study reported Chrome 10 blocked only 13% of malicious URLs, the same as Safari and Firefox, behind Internet Explorer 9 which blocked 92%, and 100% with application-based filtering enabled. Referring to that study, Ars Technica wrote in July 2011 that "Even with the false positives, Microsoft's approach appears to be more secure."

===Privacy===

====Privacy mode====

The private browsing feature called Incognito mode prevents the browser from permanently storing any history information or cookies from the websites visited.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95464&hl=en |title=Explore Google Chrome Features: Incognito Mode|date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2008[/tpl] Incognito mode is similar to the private browsing feature in other web browsers.  Chrome was the second browser to implement this feature, after Safari.

====Usage tracking====

Chrome sends details about its usage to Google through both optional and non-optional user tracking mechanisms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2008/10/google-chrome-chromium-and-google.html |title=Chromium Blog: Google Chrome, Chromium, and Google |publisher=Blog.chromium.org |date=October 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl]
Some of the tracking mechanisms can be optionally enabled and disabled through the installation interface[tpl]citation|url=http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html?brand=CHKZ |title=Google Chrome Privacy Notice |publisher=Google|date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2012[/tpl] and through the browser's options dialog. Unofficial builds, such as SRWare Iron and CoolNovo (previously known as ChromePlus), seek to remove these features from the browser altogether. The RLZ feature is not included in the Chromium browser either.
In March 2010, Google devised a new method to collect installation statistics: the unique ID token included with Chrome is now only used for the first connection that Google Update makes to its server.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/16/google_chrome_unique_identifier_change/ |title=Google Chrome Unique Identifier Change|date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2010[/tpl]
Concern about Chrome's optional usage collection and tracking have been noted in several publications.[tpl]cite news |first=Elise|last=Ackerman|title=Google browser's tracking feature alarms developers, privacy advocates|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_10510989|publisher=Mercury News[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10031661-56.html?tag=txt |title=Google's Omnibox could be Pandora's box |date=September 3, 2008|accessdate=September 4, 2008[/tpl] On September 2, 2008, a CNET news item[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10030522-2.html| title=Be sure to read Chrome's fine print |publisher=CNET |accessdate=September 3, 2008[/tpl] drew attention to a passage in the Terms of Service statement for the initial beta release, which seemed to grant to Google a license to all content transferred via the Chrome browser. The passage in question was inherited from the general Google terms of service.Redirecting On the same day, Google responded to this criticism by stating that the language used was borrowed from other products, and removed the passage in question from the Terms of Service.[tpl]cite web |title=Google Chrome Terms of Service (English)|url=http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?hl=en |accessdate=September 4, 2008[/tpl] Google noted that this change would "apply retroactively to all users who have downloaded Google Chrome".[tpl]Cite document |title=Google Amends Chrome License Agreement After Objections|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/150637/google_amends_chrome_license_agreement_after_objections.html|publisher=PC World |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=September 3, 2008 |postscript=[/tpl] There was subsequent concern and confusion about whether and what information the program communicates back to Google. The company stated that usage metrics are only sent when users opt in by checking the option "help make Google Chrome better by automatically sending usage statistics and crash reports to Google" when the browser is installed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html |title=Google Chrome Privacy Notice |accessdate=October 27, 2009[/tpl]
The optional suggestion service included in Google Chrome has been criticized because it provides the information typed into the Omnibox to the search provider before the user even hits return. This allows the search engine to provide URL suggestions, but also provides them with web usage information tied to an IP address. The feature can be selected off in the preferences-under the hood/bonnet-privacy box.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10031661-56.html |title=Google's Omnibox could be Pandora's box |accessdate=May 13, 2010 |last=Fried|first=Ina|date=September 3, 2008[/tpl]

====Do Not Track====

In February 2012, Google announced that Chrome will support Do Not Track by the end of 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://browserfame.com/478/google-chrome-support-do-not-track |title = Google and Chrome To Support Do Not Track|accessdate=March 3, 2012[/tpl]

===Speed===

The JavaScript virtual machine used by Chrome, the V8 JavaScript engine, has features such as dynamic code generation, hidden class transitions, and precise garbage collection.
Several websites performed benchmark tests using the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark tool as well as Google's own set of computationally intense benchmarks, which include ray tracing and constraint solving.[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/apis/v8/run.html|title=V8 Benchmark suite|accessdate=September 3, 2008|publisher=Google code[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl] They unanimously reported that Chrome performed much faster than all competitors against which it had been tested, including Safari (for Windows), Firefox 3.0, Internet Explorer 7, Opera, and Internet Explorer 8.[tpl]cite web|title=Google Chrome – first benchmarks.

He stated that Firefox 3.0 performed poorly on recursion-intensive benchmarks, such as those of Google, because the Mozilla team had not implemented recursion-tracing yet.[tpl]cite web|first=John|last=Resig|authorlink=John Resig|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-performance-rundown/|title=JavaScript Performance Rundown|date=September 3, 2008[/tpl]

===Stability===

A multi-process architecture is implemented in Chrome[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html|title=Multi-process Architecture |last=Reisn|first=Charlie|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=September 12, 2008[/tpl] where, by default, a separate process is allocated to each site instance and plugin. This procedure is termed process isolation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models|title=Process Models|date=September 3, 2008|work=The Chromium Projects|publisher=Google|accessdate=September 12, 2008[/tpl] and it prevents tasks from interfering with each other, raising security and stability. An attacker successfully gaining access to one application gains access to no others,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Google-Chrome-Puts-Security-in-a-Sandbox/|title=Google Chrome Puts Security in a Sandbox|last=Prince|first=Brian|date=December 11, 2008|work=eWeek.com|publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Holdings Inc|accessdate=June 4, 2010[/tpl] and failure in one instance results in a Sad Tab screen of death, similar to the well-known Sad Mac, but only one tab crashes instead of the whole application. This strategy exacts a fixed per-process cost up front, but results in less memory bloat overall as fragmentation is confined to each instance and no longer needs further memory allocations. This architecture is being adopted in upcoming versions of Safari[tpl]cite web|url=https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2010-April/012235.html |title=webkit-dev Announcing WebKit2 |publisher=Lists.webkit.org |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl] and Firefox.[tpl]cite web|url= https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2010/04/08/firefox-lorentz-beta-available-for-download-and-testing/ |title=Firefox Lorentz beta available for download and testing |date=April 8, 2010 |publisher=Mozilla[/tpl]
Chrome includes a process management utility called Task Manager which lets users see what sites and plugins are using the most memory, downloading the most bytes and overusing the CPU and provides the ability to terminate them.

===User interface===

By default, the main user interface includes back, forward, refresh/cancel and menu buttons. A home button is not shown by default, but can be added through the Settings page to take the user to the new tab page or a custom home page.[tpl]cite web|url = http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95314|title = Set your home page|accessdate = 22 May 2012|last = Google|year = 2012[/tpl]
Tabs are the main component of Chrome's user interface and as such, have been moved to the top of the window rather than below the controls. This subtle change contrasts with many existing tabbed browsers which are based on windows and contain tabs. Tabs, with their state, can be transferred seamlessly between window containers by dragging. Each tab has its own set of controls, including the Omnibox.
The Omnibox is a URL box that combines the functions of both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing Tab to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before – powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also autocomplete the URLs of sites visited often. If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.
When Google Chrome is not maximized, the tab bar appears directly under the title bar. When maximized, the tabs become flush with the top of the title bar. Like other browsers, it has a full-screen mode that hides the operating system and browser interface.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
One of Chrome's differentiating features is the New Tab Page, which can replace the browser home page and is displayed when a new tab is created. Originally, this showed thumbnails of the nine most visited web sites, along with frequent searches, recent bookmarks, and recently closed tabs; similar to Internet Explorer and Firefox with Google Toolbar, or Opera's Speed Dial. In Google Chrome 2.0, the New Tab Page was updated to allow users to hide thumbnails they did not want to appear.[tpl]cite web |url=http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/05/speedier-google-chrome-for-all-users.html |title=A Speedier Google Chrome for all users |work=Google Chrome Blog[/tpl]
Starting in version 3.0, the New Tab Page was revamped to display thumbnails of the eight most visited web sites. The thumbnails could be rearranged, pinned, and removed. Alternatively, a list of text links could be displayed instead of thumbnails. It also features a "Recently closed" bar that shows recently closed tabs and a "tips" section that displays hints and tricks for using the browser.[tpl]cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-chrome-after-year-sporting-new.html |title=Google Chrome after a year: Sporting a new stable release |author=Anthony Laforge |publisher=Google |date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl]

Chrome includes a bookmark manager that can be opened from a menu. Adding the command-line option: --bookmark-menu adds a bookmarks button to the right of the Omnibox that can be used in place of the bookmarks bar.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5350737/add-a-bookmark-button-to-google-chromes-toolbar |title=Add a Bookmark Button to Google Chrome's Toolbar |author=Kevin Purdy |publisher=Lifehacker |date=September 2, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], this function was unavailable on the Linux and Mac platforms.[tpl]cite web |url=http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21152 |title=Issue 21152: Expose UI for bookmark menu on all platforms |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |last=Google |year=2009 |month=September[/tpl]
Popup windows are associated with the tab they came from and will not appear outside the tab unless the user explicitly drags them out.
Google Chrome's "Settings" page has four sections:
*Basic includes options for the home page, search engine, and default browser.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
*Personal Stuff lets users configure and manage their synchronized data, saved passwords, form autofill, browsing data, and themes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
*Under the Hood allows changing network, privacy, download, and security settings.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
*Extensions, available since Chrome 15, allows users to install, remove, manage, and update Chrome's wide variety of browser extensions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
Like Firefox, Chrome does not have a status bar, but displays loading activity and hover-over information via a status bubble that pops up at the bottom left of the relevant page, excluding hovering over links in image maps.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
For web developers, Chrome features an element inspector similar to the one in Firebug.
Chrome has special URLs that load application-specific pages instead of websites or files on disk. Chrome also has a built-in ability to enable experimental features. Originally called about:labs, the address was changed to about:flags to make it less obvious to casual users.[tpl]cite web |url=http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/chrome/common/url_constants.cc |title=Chromium url_constants.cc |accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://lifehacker.com/5667846/chromes-aboutlabs-renamed-to-aboutflags-adds-a-warning |title=Chrome's About:Labs Renamed to About:Flags, Adds a Warning |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |last=Pash |first=Adam |year=2010 |month=October |work=LifeHacker[/tpl]
In March 2011, Google introduced a new simplified logo to replace the previous 3D logo that had been used since the project's inception. Google designer Steve Rura explained the company reasoning for the change, "Since Chrome is all about making your web experience as easy and clutter-free as possible, we refreshed the Chrome icon to better represent these sentiments. A simpler icon embodies the Chrome spirit – to make the web quicker, lighter, and easier for all."[tpl]cite web |url=http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/03/fresh-take-on-icon.html |title=A fresh take on an icon |last=Rura |first=Steve |year=2011 |month=March |accessdate=March 22, 2011[/tpl]

===Desktop shortcuts and apps===

Chrome allows users to make local desktop shortcuts that open web applications in the browser. The browser, when opened in this way, contains none of the regular interface except for the title bar, so as not to "interrupt anything the user is trying to do". This allows web applications to run alongside local software (similar to Mozilla Prism and Fluid).
This feature, according to Google, will be enhanced with the Chrome Web Store, a one-stop web-based web applications directory which opened in December 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=https://chrome.google.com/webstore|title=Chrome Web Store|date=May 19, 2010|publisher=Google|accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2010/05/chrome-web-store.html|title=The Chrome Web Store|author=Erik Lay|date=May 19, 2010|publisher=Google|accessdate=May 24, 2010[/tpl]

====Chrome Web Store====

Announced on December 7, 2010, the Chrome Web Store allows users to install web applications as extensions to the browser, although most of these function simply as links to popular web pages and/or games, but some of the apps like Springpad do provide extra features like offline access. The themes and extensions have also been tightly integrated into the new store, allowing users to search the entire catalog of Chrome extras.[tpl]Cite news|url = http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2010/12/thoughts-on-the-chrome-store-does-the-web-need-an-app-delivery-channel.ars|title = Chrome Web Store: a solution in search of a problem?|accessdate =December 10, 2010|last = Paul|first = Ryan|year = 2010|month = December| work=Ars Technica[/tpl]

===Themes===

===Automatic web page translation===

Starting with Google Chrome 4.1 the application added a built-in translation bar using Google Translate. Translation is currently available for 52 languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hlrm=ru&answer=173424|title=Support Google Chrome – Automatic web page translation[/tpl]

===Release channels and updates===

On January 8, 2009 Google introduced a new release system with three distinct channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the "Dev" channel). Before this change there were only two channels: Beta and Developer preview. All previous Developer channel users were moved to the Beta channel. The reason given by Google is that the Developer channel builds are less stable and polished than those that Developer channel users were getting during Google Chrome's Beta period. The stable channel will be updated with features and fixes once they have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel will be updated roughly monthly with stable and complete features from the Developer channel.
The Developer channel is where ideas get tested (and sometimes fail) and can be very unstable at times.[tpl]cite web |author=Mark Larson |date=January 8, 2009|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/google-chrome-release-channels.html |title=Google Chrome Release Channels |accessdate=January 9, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Mark Larson|date=January 8, 2009|url=http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2009/01/dev-update-new-webkit-version-new.html|title=Dev update: New WebKit version, new features, and a new Dev channel|accessdate=January 9, 2009[/tpl] On July 22, 2010 Google announced it will ramp up the speed it will release new stable versions; they will shorten the release cycles from quarterly to 6 weeks.[tpl]cite web|author=Anthony Laforge|date=July 22, 2010|url=http://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/release-early-release-often.html|title=Release Early, Release Often|accessdate=July 25, 2010[/tpl] The faster release cycle brought a fourth channel: the "Canary" release; the name refers to using canaries in coal mines, so if a change "kills" Chrome Canary, they will block it from the developer build. Canary will be "the most bleeding-edge official version of Chrome and somewhat of a mix between Chrome dev and the Chromium snapshot builds". Canary releases run side-by-side with any other channel; it is not linked to the other Google Chrome installation and can therefore run different synchronization profiles, themes, and browser preferences.[tpl]cite web|author=Lee Mathews|date=July 23, 2010|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2010/07/23/google-chrome-canary-run-two-channels-at-once/|title=Google drops Chrome Canary build down the Chrome mineshaft|accessdate=July 25, 2010[/tpl] It cannot be set as the default browser.

Chrome automatically keeps itself up to date. The details differ by platform.
On Windows, it uses Google Updater, and autoupdate can be controlled via Group Policy,[tpl]cite web|url=http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/05/google-update-releases-update-controls.html |title= Google Update Releases Update Controls |author=David Dorwin |date= May 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] or users can download a standalone version that does not autoupdate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/chrome/eula.html?standalone=1 |title=Google Chrome voor Windows – Overeenkomst voor de Algemene voorwaarden |publisher=Google |date=April 28, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url= http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/03/standalone-offline-installer-for-google.html |title= Standalone Offline Installer for Google Chrome |author=Alex Chitu |publisher=Google Operating System |date= March 1, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2010[/tpl] On Mac, it uses Google Update Service, and autoupdate can be controlled via the Mac OS X "defaults" system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/installer/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=147176&ctx=go|title=Google Help page "Managing updates in Google Software Update"[/tpl] On Linux, it lets the system's normal package management system supply the updates.

===Retina screen support===

Google announced in its Chrome blog that it will bring high resolution Retina support to Apple's next generation MacBook Pro. Google’s Chrome engineers already have a version of the browser ready to handle the 2880 × 1800 high-resolution screen. “We’re committed to polishing Chrome until it shines on new Pro” the Chrome team wrote, releasing an early version of the browser ([tpl]dabbr|ver.|version[/tpl] 22 Canary) with basic Retina support, and promising more soon.

===Chrome OS===

Google Chrome is the basis of Google's Chrome OS operating system that ships on specific hardware from Google's manufacturing partners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/11/google-chrome-os-ditch-your-hard-drives-the-future-is-the-web/|title=Gadget Lab Hardware News and Reviews Google Chrome OS: Ditch Your Hard Drives, the Future Is the Web|date=November 19, 2009|author=Dylan F.
