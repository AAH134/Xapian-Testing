Google Earth is a virtual globe, map and geographical information program that was originally called EarthViewer 3D, and was created by Keyhole, Inc, a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funded company acquired by Google in 2004 (see In-Q-Tel). It maps the Earth by the superimposition of images obtained from satellite imagery, aerial photography and GIS 3D globe. It was available under three different licenses, two currently: Google Earth, a free version with limited function; Google Earth Plus (discontinued),
The product, re-released as Google Earth in 2005, is currently available for use on personal computers running Windows 2000 and above, Mac OS X 10.3.9 and above, Linux kernel: 2.6 or later (released on June 12, 2006), and FreeBSD. Google Earth is also available as a browser plugin which was released on May 28, 2008. driving public interest in geospatial technologies and applications.
As of October 2011 Google Earth has been downloaded more than a billion times.http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-earth-downloaded-more-than-one.html Official post on Google Bloghttp://www.axetue.com/2011/10/12/google-earth-billion-downloads/ Google Earth Gets a Billion Downloads
For other parts of the surface of the Earth 3D images of terrain and buildings are available. Google Earth uses digital elevation model (DEM) data collected by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).Farr et al., 2007, The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, v. 45, Reviews of Geophysics, doi: 1029/2005RG000183. SRTM web site This means one can view the whole earth in three dimensions. Since November 2006, the 3D views of many mountains, including Mount Everest, have been improved by the use of supplementary DEM data to fill the gaps in SRTM coverage.
Many people use the applications to add their own data, making them available through various sources, such as the Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) or blogs mentioned in the link section below. Google Earth is able to show all kinds of images overlaid on the surface of the earth and is also a Web Map Service client. Google Earth supports managing three-dimensional Geospatial data through Keyhole Markup Language (KML).
Google Earth is simply based on 3D maps, it has the capability to show 3D buildings and structures (such as bridges), which consist of users' submissions using SketchUp, a 3D modeling program software. In prior versions of Google Earth (before Version 4), 3D buildings were limited to a few cities, and had poorer rendering with no textures. Many buildings and structures from around the world now have detailed 3D structures; including (but not limited to) those in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, India, Japan, United Kingdom,
Recently, Google added a feature that allows users to monitor traffic speeds at loops located every 200 yards in real-time. In version 4.3 released on April 15, 2008, Google Street View was fully integrated into the program allowing the program to provide an on the street level view in many locations.
On January 31, 2010, the entirety of Google Earth's ocean floor imagery was updated to new images by SIO, NOAA, US Navy, NGA, and GEBCO. The new images have caused smaller islands, such as some atolls in the Maldives, to be rendered invisible despite their shores being completely outlined.

==Uses==

Google Earth is useful for many day-to-day and other purposes.
* Google Earth can be used to view areas subjected to widespread disasters if Google supplies up-to-date images. For example after the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake images of Haiti were made available on January 17.
* With Google's push for the inclusion of Google Earth in the Classroom,[ref]
</ref> teachers are adopting Google Earth in the classroom for lesson planning, such as teaching students geographical themes (location, culture, characteristics, human interaction, and movement)<ref name="Lesson-Ganzel"></ref> to creating [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]] with other web applications such as [[Wikipedia]].<ref name="GoogleEnterprise"/><ref name="Lesson-Ganzel"/>
* One can explore and place location bookmarks on the Moon, and Mars.
* One can also get directions using Google Earth, using variables such as street names, cities, and establishments.
* Google Earth can also function as a hub of knowledge, pertaining the users location. By enabling certain options, one can see the location of gas stations, restaurants, museums, and other public establishments in their area. Google Earth can also dot the map with links to images, YouTube videos, and Wikipedia articles relevant to the area being viewed.

==Features==

===Wikipedia and Panoramio integration===

In December 2006, Google Earth added a new layer called "Geographic Web" that includes integration with Wikipedia and Panoramio. In Wikipedia, entries are scraped for coordinates via the  In March 2010, Google removed the "Geographic Web" layer. The "Panoramio" layer became part of the main layers and the "Wikipedia" layer was placed in the "More" layer.

===Flight simulator===

In Google Earth v4.2 a flight simulator was included as a hidden feature. Starting with v4.3 it is no longer hidden. Initially the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Cirrus SR-22 were the only aircraft available, and they could be used with only a few airports. In addition to keyboard control, the simulator can be controlled with a mouse or joystick. Google Earth v5.1 and higher crashes when starting flight simulator with Saitek and other joysticks.
The user can also fly underwater.

====Featured planes====

* F-16 Fighting Falcon – A much higher speed and maximum altitude than the Cirrus SR-22, it has the ability to fly at a maximum speed of Mach 2, although a maximum speed of 1678 knots (3107 km/h) can be achieved. The take-off speed is 225 knots, the landing speed is 200 knots (370 km/h).
* Cirrus SR-22 – Although slower and with a lower maximum altitude, the SR-22 is much easier to handle and is preferred for up-close viewing of Google Earth's imagery. The take-off speed is 75 knots (139 km/h), the landing speed is 70 knots ()http://googleearthflight.weebly.com/learn-how-to-fly-better.html
The flight simulator can be commanded with the keyboard, mouse or plugged-in joystick. Broadband connection and a high speed computer provides a very realistic experience.Webwise: Google's flight simulator The Sunday Times, January 27, 2008 The simulator also runs with animation, allowing objects (for example: planes])http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2009/08/planes_for_google_earth_flight_simu.html to animate while on the simulator. Image overlayshttp://www.gearthhacks.com/dlfile31271/Airbus-A400--Flight-Sim-Overlay.htm can also be added to make it look like the cockpit of a plane.

===Sky mode===

Google Sky is a feature that was introduced in Google Earth 4.2 on August 22, 2007, and allows users to view stars and other celestial bodies. as well as color images of all of the archived data from Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. Newly released Hubble pictures will be added to the Google Sky program as soon as they are issued. New features such as multi-wavelength data, positions of major satellites and their orbits as well as educational resources will be provided to the Google Earth community and also through Christian and Conti's website for Sky.http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/gsky/ Also visible on Sky mode are constellations, stars, galaxies and animations depicting the planets in their orbits. A real-time Google Sky mashup of recent astronomical transients, using the VOEvent protocol, is being provided by the VOEventNethttp://voeventnet.org/ collaboration. Google's Earth maps are being updated each 5 minutes.
Google Sky faces competition from Microsoft WorldWide Telescope (which runs only under the Microsoft Windows operating systems) and from Stellarium, a free open source planetarium that runs under Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
On March 13, 2008, Google made a web-based versionhttp://www.google.com/sky/ of Google Sky available via the internet.

===Street View===

On April 15, 2008 with version 4.3, Google fully integrated its Street View into Google Earth. In version 6.0, the photo zooming function has been removed because it is incompatible with the new 'seamless' navigation.
Google Street View provides 360° panoramic street-level views and allows users to view parts of selected cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas at ground level. When it was launched on May 25, 2007 for Google Maps, only five cities were included. It has since expanded to more than 40 U.S. cities, and includes the suburbs of many, and in some cases, other nearby cities. Recent updates have now implemented Street View in most of the major cities of Australia and New Zealand as well as parts of Canada, parts of South Africa, Denmark, Mexico, Japan, Norway, Finland, Spain, Sweden, France, the UK, Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Portugal, Taiwan, and Singapore.
Google Street View, when operated, displays photos that were previously taken by a camera mounted on an automobile, and can be navigated by using the mouse to click on photograph icons displayed on the screen in the user's direction of travel. Using these devices, the photos can be viewed in different sizes, from any direction, and from a variety of angles.

===Water and ocean===

Introduced in version 5.0 (February 2009), the Google Ocean feature allows users to zoom below the surface of the ocean and view the 3D bathymetry beneath the waves. Supporting over 20 content layers, it contains information from leading scientists and oceanographers. In 2010, Google added underwater terrain data for Lake Baikal.
In June 2011, higher resolution of some deep ocean floor areas increased in focus from 1-kilometer grids to 100 meters thanks to a new synthesis of seafloor topography released through Google Earth.http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2814 The high resolution features were developed by oceanographers at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory from scientific data collected on research cruises. The sharper focus is available for about 5 percent of the oceans (an area larger than North America). Underwater scenery can be seen of the Hudson Canyon off New York City, the Wini Seamount near Hawaii, and the sharp-edged 10,000-foot-high Mendocino Ridge off the U.S Pacific Coast. There is a Google 2011 Seafloor Tour for those interested in viewing ocean deep terrain.

===Historical Imagery===

Introduced in version 5.0, Historical Imagery allows users to traverse back in time and study earlier stages of any place. This feature allows research that require analysis of past records of various places.

===Mars===

Google Earth 5 includes a separate globe of the planet Mars, that can be viewed and analysed for research purposes. The maps are of a much higher resolution than those on the browser version of Google Mars and it also includes 3D renderings of the Martian terrain. There are also some extremely high resolution images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera that are of a similar resolution to those of the cities on Earth. Finally, there are many high resolution panoramic images from various Mars landers, such as the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, that can be viewed in a similar way to Google Street View. Interestingly enough, layers on Google Earth (such as World Population Density) can also be applied to Mars. Layers of Mars can also be applied onto Earth. Mars also has a small application found near the face on Mars. It is called Meliza, and features a chat between the user and an automatic robot speakerhttp://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/02/chat-with-martian-in-google-earth-5.html. It is useful for research on Mars, but is not recommended for normal conversations.

===Moon===

On July 20, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, Google introduced the Google Earth version of Google Moon,

===Google Earth Engine===

Google Earth Engine is a separate product, not a part of Google Earth.

===Liquid Galaxy===

Liquid Galaxy is a cluster of computers running Google Earth creating an immersive experience. It began as a Google 20% project 

==Influences==

Google Earth can be traced directly back to a small company named Autometric, now a part of Boeing. A team at Autometric, led by Robert Cowling, created a visualization product named Edge Whole Earth.  Bob demonstrated Edge to Michael T. Jones. Chris Tanner, and others at SGI in 1996. Several other visualization products using imagery existed at the time, including Performer-based ones, but Michael T. Jones stated emphatically that he had "never thought of the complexities of rendering an entire globe..." The catch phrase "from outer space to in your face" was coined by Autometric President Dan Gordon, and used to explain his concept for personal/local/global range. Edge blazed a trail as well in broadcasting, being used in 1997 on CBS News with Dan Rather, in print for rendering large images draped over terrain for National Geographic, and used for special effects in the feature film Shadow Conspiracy in 1997. In 2000, Edge Viewer was made available through the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for free.
Gordon was a huge fan of the ‘Earth’ program described in Neal Stephenson's sci-fi classic Snow Crash. Indeed, a Google Earth co-founder claimed that Google Earth was modeled after Snow Crash, graphics, which supported Clip Mapping and was inspired by the hardware texture paging capability (although it did not use the Clip Mapping) and "Powers of Ten". The first Google Earth implementation called Earth Viewer emerged from Intrinsic Graphics as a demonstration of Chris Tanner's software based implementation of a Clip Mapping texture paging system and was spun off as Keyhole Inc. Earth Viewer was the inevitable ultimate realization of the capabilities of a seamless texture paging system and many of the individuals working on Earth Viewer were Silicon Graphics alumni.

Detailed release notes/history/changelog are made available by Google.

===Imagery and coordination===

* Coordinate System and Projection
** The internal coordinate system of Google Earth is geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) on the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84) datum.
** Google Earth shows the earth as it looks from an elevated platform such as an airplane or orbiting satellite. The projection used to achieve this effect is called the General Perspective. This is similar to the Orthographic projection, except that the point of perspective is a finite (near earth) distance rather than an infinite (deep space) distance.
* Baseline resolutions
** Czech Republic: 0.1 - 0.5 m (by Eurosense / Geodis Brno)
** Slovakia: 0.5 m (by Eurosense / Geodis Slovakia)
** Hungary: 2.5 m SPOT Images. Budapest approx. 0,3 m.
** Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Andorra, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Vatican City: 1 m or better
** Balkans: 2.5 m (medium resolution)
** U.S.: 1 m (excludes Alaska & Hawaii)
** Global: Generally 15 m (some areas, such as Antarctica, are in extremely low resolution), but this depends on the quality of the satellite/aerial photograph uploaded.
* Typical high resolutions
** Europe: 0.3 m, 0.15 m (e.g. Berlin, Zurich, Hamburg), 0.1 m Prague
** U.S.: 1 m, 0.6 m, 0.3 m, 0.15 m (extremely rare; e.g. Cambridge and Google Campus, or Glendale)
* Altitude resolution:
** Surface: varies by country
** Seabed: Not previously applicable, but since the introduction of "Ocean", elevation data has been introduced (a colorscale approximating sea floor depth is "printed" on the spherical surface at views from high altitudes).
* Age: Images dates vary. The image data can be seen from squares made when DigitalGlobe Coverage is enabled. The date next to the copyright information is not the correct image date. Zooming in or out could change the date of the pictures. Most of the international urban image dates are from 2004 and have not been updated. However, most US images are kept current. Google announces imagery updates on their LatLong Blog in form of a quiz, with hints of the updated locations. The answers are posted some days later in the same blog.

===Hardware and software===

Google Earth is unlikely to operate on older hardware configurations. The most recent system requirements update document these minimum configurations:
* Pentium 3, 500MHz
* 256 Megabytes of RAM
* 400 MB free disk space
* Network speed: 128 kbit/s
* 64MB DirectX9 and 3D capable graphics card
* Resolution of 1024x768, 16-bit High Color - DirectX 9 (to run in Direct X mode)
* Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Linux or Mac OS X
The most likely cause of failure is insufficient video RAM: the software is designed to warn the user if their graphics card is not able to support Earth (this often occurs due to insufficient Video RAM or buggy graphics card drivers). The next most likely mode of failure is Internet access speed. Fast broadband Internet (Cable, DSL, T1, etc.) is required.

====Linux specifications====

;Minimum System Requirements:
* Kernel: 2.4 or later
* CPU: Pentium III, 500 MHz
* System Memory (RAM): 128 MB
* Hard Disk: 400 MB free space
* Network Speed: 128 kbit/s
* Screen: 1024x768, 16 bit color
* Tested and works on the following distributions:
Some citizens may express concerns over aerial information depicting their properties and residences being disseminated freely. As relatively few jurisdictions actually guarantee the individual's right to privacy, as opposed to the state's right to secrecy, this is an evolving point.
Perhaps aware of these critiques,[ref]Privacy Lawsuit Against Google Earth, Spatial Law blog, 2008-04-09
[/ref] for a time, Google had Area 51 (which is highly visible and easy to find) in Nevada as a default placemark when Google Earth is first installed.
As a result of pressure from the United States government, the residence of the Vice President at Number One Observatory Circle was obscured through pixelization in Google Earth and Google Maps in 2006, but has since been lifted. The usefulness of this downgrade is questionable, as high-resolution photos and aerial surveys of the property are readily available on the Internet elsewhere. Capitol Hill used to also be pixelized in this way, but this was lifted. The Royal Stables in The Hague, Netherlands used to be pixelized as well, but was partially lifted. If one zooms in too close to the Stables, it is still pixelized.
Critics have expressed concern over the willingness of Google to cripple their dataset to cater to special interests, believing that intentionally obscuring any land goes against its stated goal of letting the user "point and zoom to any place on the planet that you want to explore".
In the United Kingdom, critics have also argued that Google Earth has led to the vandalism of private property, highlighting the graffiti of a penis being drawn on the roof of a house near Hungerford,"Teenager's 60ft painting of penis on parents' roof spotted in space", The Guardian, accessed 29/05/2010 on the roof of Yarm School at Stockton on Tees"The Piddler On The Roof", The Sun, accessed 29/05/2010 and on the playing fields of a school in Southampton"Schoolyard penis seen from space", The Guardian, accessed 29/05/2010 as examples of this.
In Hazleton, Pennsylvania, media attention and critics focused on Google Earth once more because of the defacing of the Hazleton Area Highschool Football field. Grass was removed to create the image of a penis approximately 35 yards long and 20 yards wide.
Recent versions of Google Earth require a software component running in the background that will automatically download and install updates. Several users expressed concerns that there is not an easy way to disable this updater, as it currently runs without the permission of the user.

==Copyright==

Currently, every image created from Google Earth using satellite data provided by Google Earth is a copyrighted map. Any derivative from Google Earth is made from copyrighted data which, under United States Copyright Law, may not be used except under the licenses Google provides. Google allows non-commercial personal use of the images (e.g. on a personal website or blog) as long as copyrights and attributions are preserved.
By contrast, images created with NASA's globe software World Wind use The Blue Marble, Landsat or USGS layer, each of which is a terrain layer in the public domain. Works created by an agency of the United States government are public domain at the moment of creation. This means that those images can be freely modified, redistributed and used for commercial purposes.

==Layers==

Google Earth also features many layers as a source for information on businesses and points of interest, as well as showcasing the contents of many communities, such as Wikipedia, Panoramio and YouTube. Google updates with new layers often. Many Google Earth layers, such as Panoramio and Google Earth Community layers, are updated daily with entries from the respective websites.

===Borders and labels===

Contains borders for countries/provinces and shows placemarks for cities and towns.
* Borders: Marks international borders with a thick yellow line, 1st level administrative borders (generally provinces and states) with a lavender line, and 2nd level administrative borders (counties) with a cyan line. Coastlines appear as a thin yellow line. Displays names of countries, 1st level administrative areas, and islands.
* Labels: Displays labels for large bodies of water, such as oceans, seas, and bays, and populated places.

===Places of interest===

A collection of business listings provided by many local services.

===Panoramio===

Shows many of the most relevant pictures uploaded onto Panoramio's website.

===Roads===

Displays available road networks. The colors and signs displayed vary depending on the type of roadway.
* Limited-access freeways and tollways that are part of widespread networks such as the International E-road network, United States Interstate Highways and many other national road networks are represented by orange lines.
* Other freeways are marked with pale orange lines.
* Some roads in Japan are indigo.
* Other important roads, generally those most travelled, highest capacity, or bearing a road number, are labeled with yellow lines.
* All other roads are labeled white.
* Some pedestrian walkways and private roads are signified by transparent white lines, especially when greatly resembling a road intended for public automotive traffic.

===Buildings in 3D===

Shows many 3D computer building models in many cities, in these styles:
* Photorealistic: Shows many buildings in a realistic style, with more complex polygons and surface images.
* Gray: Low-detail models of city buildings designed for computers that may not have the capability of showing the photorealistic models.
Any real world building can be created for Google Earth via a number of avenues:
* Users can create their own 3D buildings with Building Maker. This browser based tool allows users to match 'boxes' to aerial imagery of certain cities. Low learning curve resulting in lower quality 3D buildings.
* Users can download SketchUp a 3D modeling application that allows users to create detailed digital representations of real world buildings. Provided the models meet Google's criteria, they can then be uploaded to the 3D warehouse and accepted to Google Earth
* There are now several companies, certified by Google,http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=1G1ACAWCENNZ334&=&q=google+certifie+geo+developers&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=#sclient=psy&hl=en&rlz=1G1ACAWCENNZ334&q=google+certified+geo+developers&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&psj=1&fp=9bef8cda26d1a6ec that provide a service creating and maintaining 3D buildings for customers. These companies generally provide high detail models.
In 2009, in a unique collaboration between Google and the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the museum selected 14 of its most important paintings to be photographed and displayed at the ultrahigh resolution of 14,000 megapixels inside the 3D version of the Prado in Google Earth and Google Maps.

===Google Street View===

Shows placemarks with 360 degree panoramic views of streets of many cities in Australia, France, United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, United States, and recently Portugal, Brazil, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Switzerland, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Norway, South Africa and Finland.
