By 2007, Google invested hundreds of millions of dollars in wind, solar, solar thermal, and geothermal projects, including a 1.6 MW solar installation pilot project at its headquarters. In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable-energy project, putting up $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 MW of power, or enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by NextEra Energy Resources, will reduce fossil fuel use in the region. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty percent stake in the project in order to get funding for project development.[tpl]cite news |title=Google Invests in Two Wind Farms |first1=Scott |last1=Morrison |first2=Cassandra |last2=Sweet |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704342604575222420304732394.html[/tpl] In addition, on July 30, 2010, Google Energy agreed to purchase 100 MW of Iowa wind energy from NextEra Energy at a fixed rate for 20 years.[tpl]cite news |newspaper=Google Blog |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/reducing-our-carbon-footprint-with.html[/tpl][tpl]cite news | agency=Reuters|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66J3BL20100720 | title=Google to use wind energy to power data centers | date=July 20, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|newspaper=MSNBC|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38329483/ns/business-going_green/[/tpl][tpl]cite news|newspaper=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/21/google-wind-farm-purchase_n_653146.html | first=Bianca | last=Bosker|title=Google Buys 20 Years' Worth Of Wind Energy To Power Data Centers|date=July 21, 2010[/tpl]  The electricity is intended to be primarily used for Google's data centers, but also may be sold on the open market.
