==Technical specifications==

==Locations==

* Kansas City, Kansas - On March 30, 2011, KCK was selected from over 1,100 applicants to be the first Google Fiber community. 
* Kansas City, Missouri - Seventeen days after the initial announcement regarding KCK, Google announced the decision to include Kansas City, Missouri, thus including the entirety of Kansas City. The network is expected to become available to residents in early 2012.

==Selection process==

Google originally stated that they would announce the winner or winners by the end of 2010; however, in mid-December, Google pushed back the announcement date of the selected Google Fiber community (or communities) to "early 2011" due to an increase in the time necessary to review all of the over 1,100 applications.
The request form was simple,Google Fiber for Communities and, some have argued, too straightforward. This led to various attention-getting behaviors by those hoping to have their town selected. Some examples are given below:
*Baton Rouge supporters remade the song "Give a Little Bit" by Roger Hodgson to "Give a Gigabit". 
*Greenville, South Carolina utilized 1000 of their citizens and glow sticks to create "The World's First and Largest People-Powered Google Chain." From an aerial view, the title "Google" was colorfully visible.
*Topeka, Kansas temporarily renamed itself "Google"
*A small plane bearing a banner reading “Will Google Play in Peoria, IL?” flew over the Google campus in Mountain View, California.
*One of the islands in Sarasota, Florida was temporarily renamed  "Google Island".
Municipalities and citizens have also uploaded YouTube videos to support their bids. Some examples:
*A YouTube video in support of Sarasota, Florida used the Bobby McFerrin  song Don't Worry, Be Happy, which Warner Music Group does not allow to appear in user-uploaded videos. A video for Sarasota was uploaded through Facebook’s video service. Duluth's mayor jokingly proclaimed that every first-born child will be named either Google Fiber or Googlette Fiber. The city of Rancho Cucamonga, California dubbed their city, "Rancho Googlemonga".
*Comedian and United States Senator Al Franken made a YouTube video to support Duluth, Minnesota's bid.Al Franken YouTube video
*Ann Arbor, Michigan has its own YouTube channelAnn Arbor YouTube channel  featuring a David Letterman-style Top Ten list delivered by town VIPs such as Mayor John Hieftje and University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman. Ann Arbor also held a city-wide GoogleFest,Ann Arbor GoogleFest  kicking off with a gathering of hundreds of participants dancing and chanting "Ann Arbor Google Fiber, ain't Nothing any finer."

==Trial near Stanford==
