Google Ideas further positions Google to influence global cultural, political and social issues. Jared Cohen, formerly with the Policy Planning Committee at the US State Department, directs Google Ideas. The think tank is organized within Google's Business Operations and Strategy area and thus is within its business operations rather than its philantrophy part.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/09/07/jared_cohen|title=State Department Innovator Goes to Google|work=Foreign Policy|date=7 September 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011[/tpl]

The team's most recent conference was the Summit Against Violent Extremism (SAVE) held in Dublin. The core team includes Scott Carpenter, Yasmin Dolatabadi, Daniel Keyserling and Brendan Ballou.
