Google Ideas, or Ideas is a cross-sector, inter-disciplinary "think tank"
In 2010, Eric Schmidt approached Jared Cohen, who had by that time gained recognition for applying forward technological thinking to diplomatic issues, to lead the new venture at Google. The team's most recent conference was the Summit Against Violent Extremism (SAVE) held in Dublin. The core team includes Scott Carpenter, Yasmin Dolatabadi, Daniel Keyserling and Brendan Ballou.
Google Ideas has come under scrutiny for its links with the US State Department and its 'regime change' activities.
