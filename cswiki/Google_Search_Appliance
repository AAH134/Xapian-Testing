Some models were based on Dell PowerEdge 2950 2U rackmount servers.

=== Scalability ===

* Multiple appliances can be linked together to scale to billions of documents
* Physical hardware can be distributed across multiple locations

=== Administration ===

Minimal support infrastructure / admin staff is needed as quoted on their web site “…doesn’t need a tech support baby-sitter. You simply plug it in, configure it, and let it run…”. The device does come with a web based admin console that can be used to make configuration changes where needed. Additional customisation is possible through a Representational State Transfer (REST) based admin API that allows for automation of tasks. There are also existing admin modules that can be used for customization.
