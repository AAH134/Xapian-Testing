Google Searchology 2009 witnessed several novel changes in the Google search options. In previous years Google has used this platform to showcase two significant improvements in its search: Universal Search and Personalized Search. Searchology 2009 focused on the users' intent.

== Wonder Wheel ==

Wonder Wheel provides the user with a flash based interface having the searched query in the middle and the related queries at its branches. The text based results are still available but shifted rightwards. As the user clicks on the related query, the wonder wheel expands and the results at the right hand side of the page changes. The main aim of the wonder wheel is to guide the user to reach to the relevant resource in an intuitive manner.

== Google Squared ==

When a search is made via Google Squared, the results are presented in the form of rows and columns. Further, these results can be exported to an online spreadsheet program whereby it can be stored into a database. 
Although it was presented to the group of media and people from search industry on May 12, 2009, yet it was not made public as Googleâ€™s Associate Product Manager Alex Komoroske admitted that owing to the search flaws in Google Squared, there is still a good amount of work to be done on it and will be launched in Google Labs by the end of this[tpl]which?|date=January 2011[/tpl] month.

== Rich Snippet ==

Rich Snippet displays additional data from other pages about the resources being displayed in the search result. In order to work, webmasters must incorporate open standards such as microformats or RDFa in their web pages. Google does not guarantee that the use of these open standards will result in rich snippets, but webmasters have the option to contact Google for its inclusion.
