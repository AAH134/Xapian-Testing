Google TV is a Smart TV platform from Google co-developed by Google, Intel, Sony and Logitech. Google TV integrates Google’s Android operating system and the Linux version of Google Chrome browser to create an interactive television overlay on top of existing internet television and WebTV sites to add a 10-foot user interface. Google TV initially launched October 6, 2010, with official devices from Sony and Logitech.
Logitech announced in November 2011 that they will stop making Google TV devices due to their losing more than $100 million on operating profits on their Logitech Revue Google TV device, which is now discontinued. No sequel is planned by Logitech.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/logitech-axes-google-tv-efforts-45662 |title=Logitech Axes Google TV Efforts |publisher=Eweekeurope.co.uk |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2012-01-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/11/logitechs-new-ceo-sees-the-failures-of-the-revue-clearly-in-hin/ |title=Logitech's new CEO sees the failures of the Revue clearly in hindsight and doesn't plan a sequel |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2011-11-11 |accessdate=2012-01-13[/tpl] New partners have joined, however, including LG, Samsung and Vizio, some of which include 3D capabilities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://googletv.blogspot.com/2011/01/samsung-and-google-tv.html |title=Samsung Plans Blu-ray Disc Google TV Release |publisher=Googletv.blogspot.com |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2012-01-13[/tpl]

==Features==

Google TV leverages many of Google’s existing products. Google’s Android operating system provides the underlying foundation, allowing developers to create applications that extend the system’s functionality. Google’s Chrome browser provides a gateway to the Internet, allowing consumers to browse web sites and watch television, in tandem. Consumers can access HBO, CNBC, and content from other providers through the Chrome browser. Partners have built applications that allow customers to access content in unique ways. Netflix, for example, has built an application that allows customers to access Netflix’s large library of movies and television shows. Android and Apple smartphones may be used as remote controls for Google TV. Google TV products ship with wireless remote controls with a full QWERTY keypad. An update in November 2011 allowed access to the Android Market and enabled search to find content from live TV, Netflix, YouTube, HBO GO, and more.[tpl]cite web|url=http://code.google.com/tv/faq.html#android |title=Frequently Asked Questions – Google TV – Google Developers |publisher=Code.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-13[/tpl]

==Reviews==

2010 - October 29. Nilay Patel, of the tech blog Engadget remarked, "Google TV feels like an incomplete jumble of good ideas only half-realized, an unoptimized box of possibility that suffers under the weight of its own ambition and seemingly rushed holiday deadline."
2010 - November 13. Kevin Sintumuang said of Google TV in his Wall Street Journal review that "The potential is as big as, well, the Internet, but right now Google TV is a bit of a tease."
2010 - November 17. The New York Times[tpl]'[/tpl] David Pogue had similar sentiments, saying, "This much is clear: Google TV may be interesting to technophiles, but it's not for average people." Concentrating more on the product's usefulness for finding and watching television shows than on its capabilities as an Internet appliance, he also expressed concern about the inconsistencies throughout the user interface as well as the fragmentation of Google TV.
2011 - July 2011. Commentators were saying "Google TV is sinking" and that it was "on its last legs" as launch partner Logitech slashed the price of its Revue (from $249 to $99) to clear unsold inventory.
2011 - November 3. Some of the same commentators praised Google TV 2.0 has having a "brilliant interface" but still lacking "substance." 

==Competitors and controversies==

Cable providers as well as content providers have been slow to warm to Google TV. NBC, ABC, CBS and Hulu have blocked Google TV enabled devices from accessing their web content since Google TV's launch. As of November 22, 2010, Google TV devices are blocked from accessing any programs offered by Viacom’s subsidiaries.  Of the cable providers, only Dish Network has embraced Google TV. Dish Network is promoting Google TV, offering customers a discount on the Logitech Revue.
