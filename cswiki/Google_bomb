The terms Google bomb and Googlewashing refer to practices, such as creating large numbers of links, that cause a web page to have a high ranking for searches on unrelated or off topic keyword phrases, often for comical or satirical purposes.  In contrast, search engine optimization is the practice of improving the search engine listings of web pages for relevant search terms.
It is done for either business, political, or comedic purposes (or a combination of the latter two). (Note: payment required, weblink goes to abstract.)
Google's search-rank algorithm ranks pages higher for a particular search phrase if enough other pages linked to it use similar anchor text (linking text such as "miserable failure"). However, by January 2007 Google had made changes to search results to counter popular Google bombs, such as "miserable failure", which formerly gave results for George W. Bush  but now lists pages about the Google bomb itself. As of April 13, 2012, the 1st ranked page in a Google search for "miserable failure" is this Wikipedia article, defining Google bomb.  Google bomb is used both as a verb and a noun. The phrase "Google bombing" was introduced to the New Oxford American Dictionary in May 2005.. Google bombing is closely related to spamdexing, the practice of deliberately modifying HTML pages to increase the chance of their website being placed close to the beginning of search engine results, or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner.
The term Googlewashing was coined in 2003 to describe the use of media manipulation to change the perception of a term, or push out competition from search engine results pages (SERPs).

==History==

Google bombs date back as far as 1999, when a search for "more evil than Satan himself" resulted in the Microsoft homepage as the top result.
In September 2000 the first Google bomb with a verifiable creator was created by Hugedisk Men's Magazine, a now-defunct online humor magazine, when it linked the text "dumb motherfucker" to a site selling George W. Bush-related merchandise.
Adam Mathes is credited with coining the term "Google bombing" when he mentioned it in an article that appeared on April 6, 2001 in the online magazine uber.nu. In the article Mathes details his connection of the search term "talentless hack" to the website of his friend Andy Pressman by recruiting fellow webloggers to link to his friend's page with the desired term.

==Uses as tactical media==

The Google Bomb has been used for tactical media as a way of performing a 'hit-and-run' media attack on popular topics. Such attacks include Anthony Cox's attack in 2003. He created a parody of the "404 – page not found" browser error message in response to the war in Iraq. The page looked like the error page but was titled "These Weapons of Mass Destruction cannot be displayed." This website could be found as one of the top hits on Google after the start of the war in Iraq.

==Alternative meanings==

The Google Bomb is often misunderstood by those in the media and publishing industry who do not retain technical knowledge of Google's ranking factors. For example, Alex Jones creates "Google Bombs" every week by dispatching instructions to his radio/internet listeners.http://hansschoff.com/mlm/google-bomb-mastering-internet-marketing-strategieshttp://www.scuttledd.com/2011/06/the-new-activism-alex-jones-and-the-next-phase-of-the-infowar/ In this context the term is used to describe a rapid and massive influx of keyword searches for a particular phrase. The keyword surge gives the illusion that the related content has suddenly become popular, however it is artificial in nature because it is created by a loyal following of people to a particular media outlet, often alternative media. The strategy behind this type of Google Bombing is to attract attention from the larger mainstream media and influence them to publish content related to the keyword.

== Google bowling ==

By studying what types of ranking manipulations a search engine is punishing, a company can provoke a search engine into lowering the ranking of a competitor's website. This practice, known as Google bowling, is often done by purchasing Google bombing services (or other SEO techniques) not for one's own website, but rather for the website of the competitor. The attacker provokes the search company into punishing the "offending" competitor by displaying their page further down in the search results. For victims of Google bowling, it may be difficult to appeal the ranking decrease because Google avoids explaining penalties, preferring not to "educate" real offenders. However if the situation is clear-cut, Google could lift the penalty after submitting a request for reconsideration.

==Beyond Google==

Other search engines use similar techniques to rank results, so Yahoo!, AltaVista, and HotBot are also affected by Google bombs. A search for "miserable failure" or "failure" on September 29, 2006 brought up the official George W. Bush biography number one on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN and number two on Ask.com. On June 2, 2005, Yooter reported that George Bush was ranked first for the keyword 'miserable', 'failure', and 'miserable failure' in both Google and Yahoo!; Google has since addressed this and disarmed the George Bush Google bomb and many others.
The BBC, reporting on Google bombs in 2002, used the headline "Google Hit By Link Bombers",

By January 2007, Google changed their indexing structure so that Google bombs such as "miserable failure" would "typically return commentary, discussions, and articles" about the tactic itself. Google announced the changes on its official blog. In response to criticism for allowing the Google bombs, Matt Cutts, the head of Google’s Webspam team, said that Google bombs had not “been a very high priority for us.”


==Motivations==

===Competitions===

In May 2004, the websites Dark Blue and SearchGuild teamed up to create what they termed the "SEO Challenge" to Google bomb the phrase "nigritude ultramarine".
The contest sparked controversy around the Internet, as some groups worried that search engine optimization (SEO) companies would abuse the techniques used in the competition to alter queries more relevant to the average user. This fear was offset by the belief that Google would alter their algorithm based on the methods used by the Google bombers.
In September 2004, another SEO contest was created. This time, the objective was to get the top result for the phrase "seraphim proudleduck". A large sum of money was offered to the winner, but the competition turned out to be a hoax.
In .net magazine, Issue 134, March 2005, a contest was created among five professional web site developers to make their site the number one listed site for the made-up phrase "crystalline incandescence".

===Political activism===

Some of the most famous Google bombs are also expressions of political opinions (e.g. "liar" leading to Tony Blair or "miserable failure" leading to the White House's biography of George W. Bush):
*In 2003, Steven Lerner, creator of Albino Blacksheep, created a parody webpage titled "French Military Victories". (payment required, link goes to abstract)
*In 2003, columnist Dan Savage began his campaign to define the word "santorum" after former US Senator Rick Santorum made several controversial statements regarding homosexuality. One search engine expert has pointed out that this campaign doesn't qualify as a google bomb, arguing that it is instead a successful new definition for a word explained by a website. (see search engine optimization)
*In 2004, Jewish writer and activist Daniel Sieradski urged visitors to his blog to link to the Wikipedia article for "Jew" in response to findings, first publicized by Steven Weinstock,
*In the same year the Persian Gulf naming dispute was the subject of a Google bomb by an Iranian blogger named Pendar Yousefi.
*Also, in 2004, a Google bomb involving searching "ladrones" (Spanish for thieves) on Google linked the SGAE website. 
*In France, groups opposing the DADVSI copyright bill, proposed by minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, mounted a Google bombing campaign linking ministre blanchisseur ("laundering minister") to an article recalling Donnedieu de Vabres' conviction for money laundering. The campaign was so efficient that, 
*In 2004, after the controversy that erupted in the Philippines over the allegations that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had cheated in the elections, the phrase "pekeng pangulo" ("fake president") was linked to her official website.
*In 2004, kretyn (Polish for moron) and similar insults referring to stupidity were linked to websites of various Polish politicians including Andrzej Lepper and Roman Giertych.
*In 2005 an Estonian blogger led a successful campaign to link the word masendav (Estonian for dismal or depressive) to the homepage of Estonian Centre Party.
*In the 2006 US midterm elections, many left-wing bloggers, led by MyDD.com, banded together to propel neutral or negative articles about many Republican House candidates to the top of Google searches for their names.
*Also in 2006, Siedziba szatana (satan's headquarters) was linked to the website of controversial Christian broadcaster Radio Maryja.
*In January 2007, Google announced they altered their search engine algorithm to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the technique.[ref]

*In January 2009, a successful Google bomb was performed against the site of the Bulgarian Government by a loose group of bloggers and forum users. It was discovered that by mistake, the robots.txt on the government.bg forbade the crawling of the site by indexing machines which allowed for Google bombing. The group linked the search term "провал" (failure) to the government site. Within a couple of days, the first search result for "провал" was the Bulgarian Government's site regardless of the search results language.
*In April 2009, the website Smart Bitches, Trashy Books launched a Google bomb against Amazon in response to its removal of ´LGBT material from their ranking lists, Amazon citing it as "adult material". Within hours of its creation the page appeared on the first page of returned search results for the term "Amazon Rank".
*In July 2009, Opie and Anthony successfully performed a new method of Google bombing in which a specific word or phrase is artificially raised in the Google Trends reporting. The phrase 'Rev Al is a racist' was made #1 on Google Trends for 07-08-09
*In France, in July 2009, "trou du cul du web" (eng :"The Asshole of the Internet") returned as the first result the official website of French president Nicolas Sarkozy; in September 2010, the same tactic resulted in President Sarkozy's Facebook page being the first result.
*In Iran, in September 2009, the phrase "ahmadinejad president of iran" returned a fake Google search page which reads, "Did you mean: ahmadinejad is NOT president of iran. No standard web pages containing all your search terms were found".
*In September 2010, 4chan users tried to Google bomb the phrase 'Robert Pisano MPAA CEO arrested for child molestation!', as a related action to DDoS attacks on the RIAA, MPAA and British Phonographic Industry (BPI) websites.

*In February 2011, pro-life activists managed to make it so that the page for abortion on English Wikipedia was the second highest ranking result for the term "murder".
*During the summer of 2011, a joke in response to Craig James’ role in the firing of Mike Leach was posted on EveryDayShouldBeSaturday.com. The joke was indexed often enough by a major search engine that typing ‘Craig James’ into the search box at the search engine resulted in the autocomplete function including ‘killed 5 hookers.’
*As of February 9, 2012, typing "cum sa te inscrii in pnl" (Romanian for "how to enlist in National Liberal Party (Romania)" brings you "Did you mean: cum sa te inscrii in pdl", PDL being Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)

===Commercial use===

Some website operators have adapted Google bombing techniques to do spamdexing. This includes, among other techniques, posting of links to a site in an Internet forum along with phrases the promoter hopes to associate with the site (see Spam in blogs). Unlike conventional message board spam, the object is not to attract readers to the site directly, but to increase the site's ranking under those search terms. Promoters using this technique frequently target forums with low reader traffic, in hopes that it will fly under the moderators' radar. Wikis in particular are often the target of this kind of page rank vandalism, as all of the pages are freely editable. This practice was also called "money bombing" by John Hiler circa 2004.
Another technique is for the owner of an Internet domain name to set up the domain's DNS entry so that all subdomains are directed to the same server. The operator then sets up the server so that page requests generate a page full of desired Google search terms, each linking to a subdomain of the same site, with the same title as the subdomain in the requested URL. Frequently the subdomain matches the linked phrase, with spaces replaced by underscores or hyphens. Since Google treats subdomains as distinct sites, the effect of many subdomains linking to each other is a boost to the PageRank of those subdomains and of any other site they link to.
On February 2, 2007, many have noticed changes in the Google algorithm that largely affects, among other things, Google bombs: only roughly 10% of the Google bombs worked as of February 15, 2007. This is largely due to Google refactoring its valuation of PageRank.

====Quixtar's bomb====

Quixtar, a multi-level marketing company, has been accused by its critics of using its large network of websites to move sites critical of Quixtar lower in search engine rankings. A Quixtar independent business owner (IBO) reports that a Quixtar leader advocated the practice in a meeting of Quixtar IBOs. Quixtar denies wrongdoing and states that its practices are in accordance with search engine rules.http://www.ojr.org/ojr/stories/050601glaser/

====GoDaddy bomb====

On December 26, 2011, a bomb was started against GoDaddy to remove them from the #1 place on google for the term "Domain Registration." This was in retaliation for supporting SOPA.
