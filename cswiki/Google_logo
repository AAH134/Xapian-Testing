Google has had several logos since its renaming from BackRub. The current official Google logo was designed by Ruth Kedar, and is a wordmark based on the Catull typeface.
The company also includes various modifications and/or humorous features, such as cartoon modifications of their logo for use on holidays, birthdays of famous people, and major events, such as the Olympics.
These special logos, some designed by Dennis Hwang, have become known as Google Doodles. Google subsidiary YouTube has also featured some custom logos to highlight special events occurring on the site, these have been unofficially nicknamed "Yoodles".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/logos/index.html |title=Google Holiday Logos |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30[/tpl]
In 1998, Sergey Brin created a computerized version of the Google letters using the free graphics program GIMP. The exclamation mark was added, mimicking the Yahoo! logo.[tpl]Cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=Mark Malseed |title=The Google Story |publisher=Bantam Dell |month=November |year=2005 |location=New York |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-553-80457-7 |page=43 [/tpl]
"There were a lot of different color iterations", says Ruth Kedar, the graphic designer who developed the now-famous logo. "We ended up with the primary colors, but instead of having the pattern go in order, we put a secondary color on the L, which brought back the idea that Google doesn't follow the rules."Zjawinski, Sonia. "How Google Got Its Colorful Logo." Wired (Online magazine). February 12, 2008. Retrieved on January 5, 2010.
In 2010, the Google logo received its first major and permanent overhaul since 1999. The new logo was first tested in November 2009,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5412305/google-searchs-new-interface-being-tested-now|title=Google Search's New Interface Being Tested Now|accessdate=2010-05-06[/tpl] and was officially launched on May 6, 2010.[tpl]Cite web|title=The Google design, turned up a notch|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-design-turned-up-notch.html|publisher=Google|accessdate=June 3, 2010|date=2010-05-06[/tpl] It utilises an identical typeface to the previous logo, but features a distinctly orange-colored "o" in place of the previous yellowish "o", as well as more subtle shadow rendered in a different shading style.

==Google Doodle==

The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998.Doodle 4 Google The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000.  Hwang has been designing the Google Doodles ever since.Hwang, Dennis. "Oodles of Doodles." Google (corporate blog). June 8, 2004. Retrieved on July 19, 2006.
Clicking on a Google Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic, which can drive a lot of traffic to unsuspecting sites.Williams, David E. "Google's unknown artist has huge following." CNN. July 19, 2006. Retrieved on July 19, 2006.
Google doodles have been produced for the birthdays of several noted artists and scientists, including Andy Warhol, Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Rabindranath Tagore, Louis Braille, Percival Lowell, Edvard Munch, Nikola Tesla, Béla Bartók, René Magritte, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, Robert Moog, Akira Kurosawa, H. G. Wells, Freddie Mercury, Samuel Morse, Hans Christian Ørsted, Mahatma Gandhi, Dennis Gabor, Constantin Brancusi, Antonio Vivaldi, Abdel Halim Hafez, and Jules Verne among others. Additionally, the featuring of Lowell's logo design coincided with the launch of another Google product, Google Maps.  Google doodles are also used to depict major events at Google, such as the company's own anniversary. The celebration of historical events is another common topic of Google Doodles including a Lego brick design in celebration of the interlocking Lego block's 50th anniversary. 
On February 14, 2007, Valentine's Day, the Google doodle featured a chocolate-dipped strawberry that combined the second "g" and the "l" as its green stem.Google logos Valentine's Day logo. February 14, 2007. Retrieved on April 6, 2007. This design gave the appearance that the "l" was missing, thereby displaying "Googe". In response to several speculations the Official Google Blog,Official Google Blog Strawberries are red, stems are green. responded: "When you look at the logo, you may worry that we forgot our name overnight, skipped a letter, or have decided that 'Googe' has a better ring to it. None of the above. I just know that those with true romance and poetry in their soul will see the subtlety immediately. And if you're feeling grouchy today, may I suggest eating a strawberry."
Google was criticized in 2007 for not featuring versions of the Google logo for American patriotic holidays such as Memorial Day and Veterans Day.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google9oct09,0,2321354.story?coll=la-home-center |title=Tweaks send Google critics into orbit (By Jim Puzzanghera, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer)October 9, 2007 |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2007-10-09 |accessdate=2010-08-30[/tpl] That year, Google featured a logo commemorating Veterans Day.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/holidaylogos07.html |title=More Google: Holiday Logos |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30[/tpl]
Google Doodles violate a long accepted tenet of brand management: that a logo must be respected and used correctly and consistently at all times. A constantly changing logo was thought to reduce brand equity. While this may be true of many brands, Google has successfully defied the orthodoxy; the Google logo has constant charming, interactive engagement that gets much press and buzz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://merriamassociates.com/2012/05/google-constant-change-is-the-brand-constant/|title=Google's Brand: Constant Change Is the Brand Constant|publisher=Merriam Associates|date=02 May 2012|accessdate=03 May 2012[/tpl]
