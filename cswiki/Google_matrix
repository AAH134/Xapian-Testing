A Google matrix is a particular stochastic matrix that is used by Google's PageRank algorithm. The matrix represents a graph with edges representing links between pages.
The rank of each page can be generated iteratively from the Google matrix using the power method. However, in order for the power method to converge, the matrix must be stochastic, irreducible and aperiodic.

==H matrix==

In order to generate the Google matrix, we must first generate a matrix H representing the relations between pages or nodes.
Assuming there are n pages, we can fill out H by doing the following:

==G matrix==

Given H, we can generate G by making H stochastic, irreducible, and aperiodic.
where N is the number of nodes.
The final Google matrix G can be computed as:
By the construction the sum of all non-negative elements inside each matrix column is equal to unit. 
Although G is a dense matrix, it is computable using H which is a sparse matrix. Usually for modern directed networks the matrix H has only about ten nonzero elements in a line, thus only about 10N multiplications are needed to multiply a vector by matrix G1,2.
for Eq.(1) within a simple network is given in the article CheiRank.

==Spectrum and eigenstates of G matrix==

stationary probability distribution 1. These probabilities 
ordered by their decreasing values give the PageRank vector
by Google search to rank webpages. Usually one has for the World Wide Web
(see e.g. 6,7). Examples of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Google matrix of various directed networks is shown in Fig.3 from 14 and Fig.4 from 7.
The Google matrix can be also constructed for the Ulam networks generated by the Ulam method 8 for dynamical maps. The spectral properties of such matrices are discussed in 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. In a number of cases the spectrum is described by the fractal Weyl law 10,12.

==Historical notes==

The Google matrix with damping factor was described by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998 20, see also articles PageRank and 21,22.
