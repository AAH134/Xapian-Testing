Googlefight is a website that allows users to compare the number of search results returned by Google for two given queries. The results are displayed graphically in a mixed  Flash and JavaScript animation. Two animated stick figures fight on screen after the queries are entered, and then an animated bar graph appears showing the results. The stick figure animation has no impact on the actual results. The results may be comforting, funny or self-referential.
