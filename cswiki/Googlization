Googlization is a neologism that describes the expansion of Google's search technologies and aesthetics into more and more markets, web applications, and contexts, including traditional institutions such as the library [tpl]cite book|last=Rogers|first=Richard|chapterurl=http://www.govcom.org/publications/full_list/rogers_inculpable_engine_2009.pdf|chapter=The Googlization Question, and the Inculpable Engine|url=http://world-information.org/wii/deepsearch-book_en/|title=Deep Search: The Politics of Search Beyond Google|year=2009[/tpl] (see Google Books Library Project). The rapid rise of search media, particularly Google, is part of new media history and draws attention to issue of access and to relationships between commercial interests and media.[tpl]cite book|last=Gorman|first=Lyn|coauthor=David McLean|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405149353.html|title=Media and Society into the 21st Century: A Historical Introduction|location=UK|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|pages=231, 253–254[/tpl]

==History of term==

In 2003, John Battelle and Alex Salkever first introduced the term ‘googlization’ to mean the dominance of Google over nearly all forms of informational commerce on the web.[tpl]cite news|first=John|last=Battelle|url=http://battellemedia.com/archives/000145.php|title=The "Creeping Googlization" Meme|work=BusinessWeek Online|date=16 Dec 2003[/tpl] Initially specializing in text-based Internet searching, Google has expanded its services to include image searching, web-based email, online mapping, video sharing, news delivery, instant messaging, mobile phones, and services aimed at the academic community. Google has entered partnerships with established media interests such as Time Warner AOL, News Corporation, the New York Times, and various new agencies such as Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, and the UK Press Association. Google has therefore become a giant with complex entanglements with traditional and new media.

==Definition==

The term Googlization is not universally accepted as a definition for this phenomenon. It is defined not only as a corporate entity, but also in the more general sense, as both a noun and a verb.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] According to Harro Haijboer, Googlization seems to be an undisputed term, most of the time the term is taken for fact without critically investigating it. “The term may be valid in current development but, after a critical look at the history of search engines, may not be as correctly formulated as one might think. My main questions are if the term Googlization is correct in a historical perspective? If Microsoft search engines (MSN, Live Search and Bing) are Googlized? …or if Google is ‘Microsoftized’? I suspected to find evidence that both search engines (Microsoft and Google) have had their influence onto each other. There is no way of saying if Googlization has fully taken place on Microsoft search or that there has been a form of ‘Microsoftization’ on the part of Google. In  this light the term Googlization seems to be inappropriate and should be rethought of.”.[tpl]Cite web|last=Haijboer|first=Harro| url= http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2009/12/21/rethinking-googlization/#comments |title= Rethinking Googlization |location=World Wide Web |publisher= Universiteit van Amsterdam |year=2009[/tpl]
Many information professionals would define the term as ‘digitizing a library or making something into a Google product.’.[tpl]cite article|last=Weldon|first=Lorette| url= |http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FWE/is_3_13/ai_n32070595/|title= The ‘Googlization’ of the library collection: by taking advantage of several Google applications, members of an associate enjoyed greater access to a resource center’s collection and were able to collaborate on many of their research efforts|location=World Wide Web |publisher= BNET UK |year=2009[/tpl] However, the definition is constantly and rapidly changing. Googlization can also mean that ever ‘increasing amounts of accessible information are available on the Internet; Google makes it easy & convenient to find in one place’, however, Google only makes information which already exists more accessible, rather than creating new information.[tpl]cite article|last=Repplinger|first=John| url= |http://www.slideshare.net/rajat00001in/googlization-of-information|title= The Googlization of Information: Google’s Influential Reach Over Information|location=World Wide Web |publisher= slideshare |year=2007[/tpl]

==Development==

Since 2000, media scholars have analyzed and are aware of the impact of Googlization to modern human society.[tpl]citation needed |date=June 2012[/tpl] Geert Lovink argues against the society’s growing dependency on Google search retrieval.[tpl]cite news|last=Lovink|first=Geert|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-09-05-lovink-en.html|title=The society of the query and the Googlization of our lives|work=Eurozine.com|year=2008[/tpl]Richard A. Rogers points out that Googlization connotes media concentration—an important political economy style critique of Google’s taking over of one service after another online; Liz Losh also claims that the Googlization of the BNF has brought considerable public attention in major magazine and newspapers in France.[tpl]cite web|url=http://virtualpolitik.blogspot.com/2009/09/googlization-of-bnf.html|title=The Googlization of the BNF|work=Virtualpolitik at BlogSpot.com|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=September 18, 2009[/tpl]
The Googlization of Everything, a book published in March 2011 by Siva Vaidhyanathan, provides a critical interpretation of how Google is disrupting culture, commerce, and community. In Vaidhyanathan’s own words “the book will answer three key questions: What does the world look like through the lens of Google?; How is Google's ubiquity affecting the production and dissemination of knowledge?; and how has the corporation altered the rules and practices that govern other companies, institutions, and states?” The author, Siva Vaidhyanathan, also has a blog where he documented the development of the book and any developments or news about Googlization and Google in general. Both the book and the blog are subtitled “How One Company is Disrupting Culture, Commerce, and Community… and Why we Should Worry.” The sentiments expressed by both the book and the blog seem to be typical of many cultural commentators[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl].

==Criticisms of googlization==

The founders of Google have encountered hostility to their enterprise almost since its inception, both in the form of general press criticism and actual legal action. Various lawsuits have included infringement of copyright law; its dealings with advertising companies and in the volume of advertising that its users encounter.[tpl]cite book|last=Boulton|first=Clint| url= http://googlewatch.eweek.com/content/google_lawsuits/ |title=eweek Google Watch blog |location=World Wide Web|publisher=Ziff David Enterprise|year=2009[/tpl]
Also, despite Google’s general market dominance, some of its offshoots and additional projects have been less than successful. Nexus One (direct-to-customer sales) and Google Buzz (social networking site) all encountered problems when they were first established, problems which they are still struggling with. Also, in early February 2010, Google deleted years worth of archives from six popular music blogs due to receiving several DMCA notices from music copyright holders alleging that music was being shared illegally. This has proved to be controversial for Google.[tpl]Cite web|last=Cringely|first=Robert X.| url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/189829/2010_is_becoming_the_year_of_google_screwups.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a38:g2:r3:c0.061153:b31075138:z0|title=2010 is becoming the year of Google Screwups |location=World Wide Web|publisher=InfoWorld |year=2010[/tpl]
In terms of Googlization there is a deep mistrust among some members[tpl]who?|date=June 2012[/tpl] of the general public.[tpl]citation needed |date=June 2012[/tpl] They[tpl]who?|date=June 2012[/tpl] believe that “Google is somehow taking over the world, like some sinister, evil megalomaniac - the latest in a long line of corporate colonisers and cultural imperialists, like Coca-Cola and McDonald's.”.[tpl]cite web|last=Visser|first=Wayne| url= http://csrinternational.blogspot.com/2009/03/googlization-for-better-or-worse.html|title=Googlization: For Better or Worse? |location=World Wide Web|publisher=CSR International|year=2009[/tpl]

==Defense of googlization==

Google has stated that its mission is "to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful".[tpl]cite web|last=Khalid|first=Fraz| url= http://blog.magofe.com/2010/03/facts-and-figures-about-google/|title= Facts and Figures About Google |location=World Wide Web|publisher= Magoffe: Your Technology Guide|year=2010[/tpl] However, Google has become aware of the level of criticism it has been receiving, and has commented that "believe it is popular because it offers useful products and services for millions of people. Google's motto is "Don't be evil" and its vision is to make all knowledge freely available to everyone on the planet."
Others[tpl]who?|date=June 2012[/tpl] have pointed out that the majority of the criticism directed at Google comes from its rivals and competitors.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] Amongst ordinary internet users however, Google is viewed fairly favorably as a search tool and as a company in general.”[tpl]cite web|last=Volpe|first=Mike url= http://theeprovocateur.blogspot.com/2008/07/defending-google.html|title= The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help’: Defending Google |location=World Wide Web|publisher= blogger.com|year=2008[/tpl]
In late March 2010, Google discontinued its local domain for China while continuing to offer their uncensored Hong Kong-based domain. Google had initially offered a censored version of their search engine in China. They reversed this decision when they decided that it was in conflict with their mission and their ideals. Speaking for Google, one of its founders, Sergey Brin, said "One of the reasons I am glad we are making this move in China is that the China situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls.".[tpl]Cite web|last=Vascellaro|first= Jessica url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704266504575141064259998090.html|title= Brin Drove Google to Pull Back in China|location=World Wide Web|publisher= The Wall Street Journal Online|year=2010[/tpl] In another interview, Brin said “For us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Internet. We believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the Internet."
