Free and open source software (FOSS) can be used with a variety of graphics hardware, largely via the X.Org project. There are varying levels of support, ranging from completely working drivers to unsupported hardware. Some manufacturers do not provide open source drivers or technical documentation suitable for independent developers to write accelerated 3D device drivers; support for products from these companies can be limited: they may provide only binary drivers (known as binary blobs) or lack of documentation may leave developers of open source drivers to reverse engineer their products or not support them at all. In the case of binary drivers there are also objections due to free software philosophy, software quality and security concerns.Linux Weekly News, Aug 14, 2006: X.org, distributors, and proprietary modules
A widely known source for performance information is the free3d.org site, 090501 free3d.org which collects 3D performance information—specifically glxgears frame rates—submitted by users. On the basis of what it concedes is an inadequate benchmark,free3d.org - FAQ: "Is glxgears an accurate measure of 3D performance? No, it sucks in multiple ways." the site currently lists ATI's Radeon HD 4670 as recommended for "best 3D performance." Additionally, Phoronix routinely runs benchmarks comparing free driver performance.

==Free software support==

In general, the vesa driver supports most graphics cards without acceleration and with display resolutions limited to a set of resolutions programmed in the video BIOS by the manufacturer.

===ATI/AMD===

Currently support for ATI hardware is provided by the radeon driver, with the majority of cards being supported by either the R300g or R600g Gallium 3D drivers. R300g supports the R300, R400, and R500 series of cards, while R600g supports the R600, R700, R800, and the R900 series.The Direction Of ATI Radeon Graphics In Ubuntu 11.04 Phoronix, March 08, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel) Older Radeon cards such as the R100 and R200 series still use a classic Mesa driver. The radeon drivers provide 2D and Xv acceleration, with 3D support available for almost all supported cards. Full Modesetting support is also available.
Feature matrices are available for radeon from Freedesktop.org. In addition, they also host the RadeonProgram, which aims to have a community maintained application compatibility database similar to the Wine project's AppDB.  
ATI released programming specifications for a number of chipsets and features in 2007, 2008 and 2009. AMD also does some active development and support for the radeon driver.An overview of graphic card manufacturers and how well they work with Ubuntu Ubuntu Gamer, January 10, 2011 (Article by Luke Benstead) This is in direct contrast to AMD's main competitor in the graphics field Nvidia, which does offer its own proprietary driver similar to AMD Catalyst, but does not provide any support or assistance to any free graphics initiatives.Nvidia's Response To Recent Nouveau Work Phoronix, December 14, 2009 (Article by Michael Larabel) AMD had just two engineers working full time on the free drivers, namely Alex Deucher and Richard Li, although they decided to work to expand their free graphics team.AMD's Hiring Open-Source Graphics Developers Still Phoronix, May 12, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel) They recently hired three more developers, with one of the developers going to be working on the desktop graphics stack and the other two on embedded open-source priorities.AMD Already Adds On Two Open-Source Developers Phoronix, May 14, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel) The developers in question have now been confirmed to be veteran graphics coders Michel Dänzer (taking over from Richard) and Christian KönigAMD's New Open-Source Employees Phoronix, July 5, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel), as well as Tom Stellard.

=== Nvidia ===

Nvidia, in the past, provided documentation for the older RIVA TNT series chipsets and maintained the open source (but partially obfuscated) 2D-only nv driver for X.Org.X.org nv driver page However, this features neither 3D acceleration nor motion compensation.The nv(4) man page On March 26, 2010, Nvidia announced that it would stop supporting new technologies and GPUs in nv, stating that

The nouveau driver project aims to reverse engineer Nvidia's cards to produce 3D acceleration for X.Org  utilizing Gallium 3D.  While still at an early stage of development, several distributions of Linux, starting with Fedora, have chosen to use nouveau as the default open-source driver for Nvidia cards.nouveau : Open Source 3D acceleration for Nvidia cardsNouveau To Enter The Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Kernel Phoronix, November 23, 2009 (Article by Michael Larabel) The nouveau driver can already manage to offer competitive 3D performance on lower end Nvidia graphics hardware, when compared to the official binary driver.On Low-End GPUs, Nouveau Speeds Past The Nvidia Driver Phoronix, March 19, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel)Nouveau's OpenGL Performance Approaches The Nvidia Driver Phoronix, March 21, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel) On March 26th, 2012, the Noveau driver was marked as stable and promoted from the staging area of the Linux kernel.

=== Intel ===

Intel has a long history of producing or commissioning open source drivers for its graphics chips, with the notable exception of their latest GMA 500 chip that severely lacks documentation. The driver development is outsourced to Tungsten Graphics.
There are currently two versions of the Intel X.Org driver, the xorg-video-i810 driver which supports the i810 and a number of more recent chipsets
In addition, the xorg-video-intel driver (sometimes known as the "modesetting driver") does not use the video BIOS for switching video modes; as some BIOSes include only a limited range of modes, this provides more reliable access to those supported by Intel video cards.
Unlike the radeon and nouveau drivers, Intel does not intend to utilize the Gallium 3D framework for its graphics drivers. Intel has also recently put work into optimizing their free Linux drivers to have closer performance to their Windows counterparts, especially on Sandy Bridge hardware where various performance optimizations have now allowed the free Intel driver to be able to outperform their proprietary Windows drivers at certain tasks. Some of these performance enhancements can also benefit users of older hardware.

=== Matrox ===

* Matrox Mystique
* Matrox Parhelia
* Matrox G200
* Matrox G400
* Matrox G500
Matrox provides open source drivers for all their chipsets older than the G550; chipsets newer then the G550 are only supported by a closed source driver.

=== ARM ===

ARM Holdings develops the
* Mali series GPUs and sells soft IP or hard IP to licensees.
On January 21st 2012, Phoronix reported that Luc Verhaegen was driving a reverse-engineering attempt aimed at the ARM Holdings Mali series of GPUs, specifically the MALI200 and MALI400 versions. The reverse-engineering project was presented at FOSDEM, february 4th 2012. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvRJ_8K8baInot up yet?Phoronix, Jan 21 2012: An Open-Source, Reverse-Engineered Mali GPU DriverFOSDEM schedule, Jan 21 2012: Liberating ARM's Mali GPU

=== Imagination Technologies ===

Imagination Technologies develops the 
* PowerVR series of GPUs and sells them as IP core (Intellectual Property), e.g. there are a couple of PowerVR based-Intel GPUs but mostly used in mobile SoCs.
Imagination Technologies do not provide a FOSS driver nor any documentation for their products. The Free Software Foundation has put reverse-engineering of the PowerVR driver on a high-priority project list.Free Software Foundation, Apr 25, 2005: High Priority Free Software Projects

=== Qualcomm ===

Qualcomm develops and manufactures the
* Adreno GPU series, mostly as part of their Snapdragon (system on chip).
On April 14th, 2012, Phoronix and Slashdot reported that Rob Clark was working on reverse-engineering the Qualcomm Adreno (ex ATI Imageon) GPU as found in their Snapdragon mobile platform.[ref]
</ref><ref>
</ref> Rob wrote in a referenced blog post that he is doing the project in his spare time, and that the Qualcomm platform was his only viable target for working on open 3D graphics since his employers ([[Texas Instruments]] and [[Linaro]]) were affiliated with the [[Imagination Technologies|Imagination]] [[PowerVR]] and [[Mali (GPU)|ARM Mali]] cores which would otherwise have been his primary targets, and that he already had working command streams for 2D support, and that 3D commands seemed to have the same characteristics.<ref>
</ref> The driver code was published on [[Gitorious]] under the name ''freedreno''.<ref>[https://gitorious.org/freedreno/ Freedreno, 15 April 2012]</ref>

=== Broadcom ===

Broadcom develops and manufactures the
* VideoCore GPU series. E.g. the Raspberry Pi uses it.
There are no FOSS drivers available for VideoCore.

=== Other vendors===

SiS and VIA have both shown limited interest and communication regarding open source drivers; however, both have released source code which has later been integrated into X.Org by FOSS developers. In July 2008, VIA opened up documentation for their products to improve its image within the Linux and open-source communities. On January 06, 2011 it was announced that VIA was no longer interested in supporting free graphics initiatives.VIA's Open Linux Graphics Driver Has Been Defenestrated Phoronix, January 06, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel) 
DisplayLink have announced an open source project called libdlo with the goal of bringing support for their USB graphics technology to Linux and other platforms. The code is available under the LGPL license. It has not yet been integrated into an X.Org driver. Displaylink graphics support is available through the kernel udlfb driver (with fbdev) in mainline, and udl/drm driver, which as of March 2012 is only available in the drm-next tree.
Often other non-hardware related vendors may also lend a hand to free graphics initiatives. Red Hat has some employees working full time on several free and open source software projects, such as two full-time employees working on the free software radeon (David Airlie and Jérôme GlisseAMD's Hiring Another Open-Source Driver Developer Phoronix, December 11, 2010 (Article by Michael Larabel)) and one full-time employee working on the free software nouveau graphic drivers. In addition, the Fedora Project runs a "Fedora Graphics Test Week" event before the launch of their new Linux distribution versions in order to provide rigorous testing to free graphics drivers.It's Fedora Graphics Test Week Phoronix, February 22, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel) Other companies that have provided development or support include Novell and VMware.

==Problems with binary drivers==

There are a number of objections to binary-only drivers. These may be philosophical, with some feeling that drivers distributed without source code are against the beliefs of the free software movement, or pragmatic copyright, security or reliability concerns. As part of a wider campaign against binary blobs, OpenBSD lead developer Theo de Raadt has pointed out that with a binary driver there is "no way to fix it when it breaks (and it will break)" and that once a product which relies on binary drivers is declared to be end-of-life by the manufacturer, it is effectively "broken forever." a comment that has been somewhat vindicated by flaws found in binary drivers, including in October 2006 an exploitable bug in Nvidia's 3D drivers discovered by Rapid7.Rapid7 advisory: Buffer Overflow in Nvidia Binary Graphics Driver For Linux.  It is speculated that this bug has existed since 2004, although Nvidia have denied this, asserting that the issue was only communicated to them in July 2006 and that the 2004 bug was a bug in X.Org, not in Nvidia's driver.Linux - How does the Rapid7 Advisory R7-0025 affect the Nvidia Unix driver?
Another problem with binary drivers is that they often do not work with current versions of open source software, and almost never support development snapshots of open source software - e.g. it is usually not directly possible for a developer to use Nvidia's or ATI's proprietary drivers with a development snapshot of an X server or a development snapshot of the Linux kernel.
In the Linux kernel development community, Linus Torvalds has made strong statements on the issue of binary-only modules, asserting: "I refuse to even consider tying my hands over some binary-only module", and continuing: "I want people to know that when they use binary-only modules, it's THEIR problem".Linus Torvalds, kernel mailing list, Feb 7, 1999. Another kernel developer, Greg Kroah-Hartman, has commented that a binary-only kernel module does not comply with the kernel's license—the GNU General Public License—it "just violates the GPL due to fun things like derivative works and linking and other stuff."Myths, Lies, and Truths about the Linux kernel by Greg Kroah-Hartman
Writer and computer scientist Peter Gutmann has expressed concerns that the digital rights management scheme in Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system may limit the availability of the documentation required to write open drivers as it "requires that the operational details of the device be kept confidential."

==Open hardware projects==

The Project VGA aims to create a low budget, open source, VGA compatible video card. All information to create one is available, but at present there seems to be no development. Some data: 090503 wacco.mveas.com
* PCI bus interface (32 bit, 33/66 MHz, 3,3/5V compatible)
* Xilinx Spartan-3 S400 FPGA (aiming for ~100 MHz)
* 16 MB SDRAM (aiming for ~166 MHz)
* Onboard programmer with USB interface
* Analog (HD15) VGA output connector.
The Open Graphics Project is another aim at creating an open hardware GPU. The Open Graphics Device v1 features dual DVI-I outputs and 100-pin IDC connector. On September 2010, the first 25 OGD1 boards were made available for grant application and purchase ($750).
The Milkymist system-on-chip, targeted at embedded graphics instead of desktop computers, supports a VGA output, a limited vertex shader and a 2D texturing unit.
