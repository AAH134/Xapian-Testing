HLSL2GLSL is a command line tool and a library that translates DirectX 9 High Level Shader Language (HLSL) shaders into the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). HLSL2GLSL was released by ATI Technologies under a BSD License.
Last version (v0.9) from ATI was released in 2006, but the project was forked in 2010  to translate Cg/HLSL shaders into GLSL for mobile platforms.
