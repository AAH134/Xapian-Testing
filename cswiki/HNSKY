HNSKY or Hallo Northern Sky is a freeware planetarium program for Microsoft Windows to simulate the night sky. It is provided with several non-English language modules, as well as several stellar databases.
HNSKY was originally created by Dutchman Han Kleijn in 1998, who continues to develop and maintain the application.
Initially a basic planetarium program, it has expanded in functionality to include the ability to control computerised GoTo telescope mounts, and is ASCOM compliant.
