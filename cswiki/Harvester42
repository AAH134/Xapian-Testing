The Harvester42 is a meta search engine project hosted at KIT  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.  Harvester42 queries over 30 major search engines in parallel and presents a large result page with the individual search engine results. The name "Harvester42" originates from the Bioinformatic Harvester project, a meta search engine for genes and proteins from several species. Harvester42 is based on the same method integrating several distributed data sources.   

== Introduction ==

Currently no search engine covers the entire internet. Often a search across several search 
engines is more successful than a single search engine search. Meta search engines usually 
integrate several search engines with complementing indices. Harvester42 covers popularity based 
search engines (Google), proprietary search algorithms (cuil), open source search engines (YaCY), 
product search engines (Directindustry, Google products), Video search (youtube) and powerful 
meta search engines (Polymeta, Allplus, Mamma).
