Although the exchange energy becomes elusive at large internuclear systems, it is of prominent importance in theories of molecular binding and magnetism. This splitting results from the symmetry under exchange of identical nuclei (Pauli Exclusion Principle).

==Theory==

The basic idea pioneered by Holstein and Herring approach can be illustrated for the hydrogen molecular ion or more generally, atom-ion systems or one-active electron systems, as follows.  We consider states that are represented by even or odd functions with respect to behavior under space inversion.  This is denoted with the suffixes g and u from the German gerade and ungerade and are standard practice for the designation of electronic states of diatomic molecules, whereas for atomic states the terms even and odd are used.   The electronic Schrödinger equation can be written as:
For any ungerade (or odd) state, the corresponding wave equation can be written as:
This implies that:
Also, these localized functions are normalized, which leads to:
and conversely.  Integration of the above in the whole space left to the mid-plane yields:
and
