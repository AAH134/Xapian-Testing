Hula Girl is a freeware Dashboard Widget for Mac OS X. Following its debut on April 29, 2005, Hula Girl was the second most downloaded widget, and three years later it remains in the top 20. Hula Girl does not do anything but jiggle. It's purely a cosmetic enhancement to one's dashboard.
As of March, 2008, Hula Girl is currently in version 3.0 and has been downloaded nearly two million timesâ€”over a million of which are for the latest version.

== Hula Girl Sightings ==

Despite Hula Girl's popularity, all demonstrations of Dashboard by Apple, Inc. CEO Steve Jobs did not contain Hula Girl until he spoke at the WWDC on August 8, 2006, when the widget was spotted adorning his computer. It is speculated that Jobs shunned Hula Girl for a year as it trivialized the functionality of Mac OS X's new Dashboard software.
Hula Girl also makes a cameo appearance in I am not American by the Arrogant Worms.

== Developers ==

Hula Girl was developed by a group of folks from Clubhouse54, a loosely knit band of Mac users inspired by petikas on October 31, 2004. The widget was then coded by John Pennypacker, co-designed by Pennypacker, and John Williams, and ultimately hosted by Williams.

== Accolades ==

Hula Girl reviews are available from Dashboard Widgets and MacUpdate, and a page describing the widget is available on Apple's web site.
