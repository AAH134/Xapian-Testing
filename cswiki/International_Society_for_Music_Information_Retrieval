The International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is international forum for research on the organization of music-related data. It began with a steering committeeISMIR Official Page in 2000, and was later incorporated in Canada on July 4, 2008.

==Purpose==

Given the tremendous growth of digital music and music metadata in recent years, methods for effectively extracting, searching, and organizing music information have received widespread interest from academia and the information and entertainment industries. The purpose of ISMIR is to provide a venue for the exchange of news, ideas, and results through the presentation of original theoretical or practical work. By bringing together researchers and developers, educators and librarians, students and professional users, all working in fields that contribute to this multidisciplinary domain, the conference also serves as a discussion forum, provides introductory and in-depth information on specific domains, and showcases current products.
As the term Music Information Retrieval (MIR) indicates, this research is motivated by the desire to provide music lovers, music professionals and music industry with robust, effective and usable methods and tools to help them locate, retrieve and experience the music they wish to have access to. MIR is a truly interdisciplinary area, involving researchers from the disciplines of musicology, cognitive science, library and information science, computer science and many others.

==Annual Conference==

Since its inception in 2000, ISMIR has been the world’s leading forum for research on the modelling, creation, searching, processing and use of musical data. Researchers across the globe meet in the annual conference, International Conference on Music Information Retrieval, conducted by the society. It is known by the same acronym as the society, the ISMIR. Following is the list of previous conferences held by the society.
