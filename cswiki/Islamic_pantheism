It also teaches that all humans are brothers and sisters and that humans as a species should care for each other and aid the development of each other.It also teaches that there is possibly life on other worlds and that this life may also be intelligent, not to be confused with Jinn who are different beings altogether in Islamic Mythology.

== Historical/general notes==

Islamic Pantheism is a world movement which was originally (partially) founded by Averroes and known as Averroism however due to war throughout the Muslim world one of them being the Mongol invasion lead to the eventual downfall of development of philosophy, mathematics and science. The new world movement originally started by speech throughout the Muslim world the one piece of evidence we have is of an online group on a social networking site which openly voices that they are Islamic pantheists. Although they are small they seek to restore peace and prosperity through science and philosophy not just pure religion.They also believe in animal rights and human rights and that every human being is equal no matter race, religion or gender.

==The beginning==

the modern movement began on the 10th of June 2010. It was founded by Polymath and logician Ismail Mahmood first by speech and then through the internet. Ismail is a Muslim but does not declare himself as part of any sectarian, after seeing violence and hearing of violence in his home nation of Kashmir Ismail decided to somehow bring Islam and the world religions together in a peaceful and harmonious manner. He continues this mission to date seeking to make Islam and the modern world co-operate in a fruitful/prosperous way. The conflict was known as the Kashmir conflict.
