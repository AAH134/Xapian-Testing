In physics and mathematics, the κ-Poincaré algebra, named after Henri Poincaré, is a deformation of the Poincaré algebra into an Hopf algebra. In the bicrossproduct basis, introduced by Majid-RueggMajid-Ruegg, Phys. Lett. B 334 (1994) 348, ArXiv:hep-th/9405107 its commutation rules reads:
The coproducts are:
The antipodes and the counits:
The κ-Poincaré algebra is the dual Hopf algebra to the κ-Poincaré group, and can be interpreted as its “infinitesimal” version.
