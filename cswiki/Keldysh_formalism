In condensed matter physics,  the Keldysh formalism is a general framework for describing the quantum mechanical evolution of  a system in a non-equilibrium state, e.g. in the presence of time varying fields (electrical field, magnetic field etc.). The main mathematical object in the Keldysh formalism is the non-equilibrium Green's function.
