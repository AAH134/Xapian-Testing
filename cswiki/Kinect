Kinect is a motion sensing input device by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 video game console and Windows PCs. Based around a webcam-style add-on peripheral for the Xbox 360 console, it enables users to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without the need to touch a game controller, through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands.[tpl]cite web |title="Project Natal" 101 |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/4/A/A4A457B3-DF5D-4BF2-AD4E-963454BA0BCC/ProjectNatalFactSheetMay09.zip |publisher=Microsoft |date=[tpl]Date|2009-06-01|mdy[/tpl] |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2009-06-02|mdy[/tpl] |archiveurl=http://blog.seattlepi.com/digitaljoystick/archives/169993.asp |archivedate=[tpl]Date|2009-06-01|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] The project is aimed at broadening the Xbox 360's audience beyond its typical gamer base.[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/06/microsofte3.html|title=E3: Microsoft shows off gesture control technology for Xbox 360|last=Pham|first=Alex|date=[tpl]Date|2009-06-01|mdy[/tpl]|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=[tpl]Date|2009-06-01|mdy[/tpl]|quote=The effort aims to attract a broader audience to Microsoft's console.

Kinect builds on software technology developed internally by Rare, a subsidiary of Microsoft Game Studios owned by Microsoft, and on range camera technology by Israeli developer PrimeSense, which developed a system that can interpret specific gestures, making completely hands-free control of electronic devices possible by using an infrared projector and camera and a special microchip to track the movement of objects and individuals in three dimension."MIT" The 50 most innovative companies 2011, MIT technological review[tpl]citation|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=[tpl]Date|2009-09-05|mdy[/tpl]|title=How many vendors does it take to make Microsoft’s Project Natal game control system?|periodical=Venture Beat|url=http://venturebeat.com/2009/09/05/how-many-vendors-does-it-take-to-make-microsofts-project-natal-game-control-system/|accessdate=[tpl]Date|2010-01-08|mdy[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]Cite news|last=Press|first=MS|date=[tpl]Date|2010-03-31|mdy[/tpl]|title=PrimeSense Supplies 3-D-Sensing Technology to Project Natal for Xbox 360|periodical=MsPress|page=MsPress|url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/mar10/03-31PrimeSensePR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases|accessdate=[tpl]Date|2010-03-31|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] This 3D scanner system called Light Coding[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.primesense.com/?p=535 |title=© 2010 PrimeSense Ltd. | FAQ |publisher=Primesense.com |date= |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2011-03-16|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] employs a variant of image-based 3D reconstruction.[tpl]cite web|author=mirror2image | url=http://mirror2image.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/how-kinect-works-stereo-triangulation/ |title=How Kinect depth sensor works – stereo triangulation? |publisher=Mirror2image.wordpress.com |date=[tpl]Date|2010-11-30|mdy[/tpl] |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2011-03-16|mdy[/tpl][/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.futurepicture.org/?p=116 |title=» Kinect Hacking 103: Looking at Kinect IR Patterns. |publisher=Futurepicture |date=[tpl]Date|2010-11-17|mdy[/tpl] |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2011-03-16|mdy[/tpl][/tpl]
The Kinect sensor is a horizontal bar connected to a small base with a motorized pivot and is designed to be positioned lengthwise above or below the video display. The device features an "RGB camera, depth sensor and multi-array microphone running proprietary software",[tpl]cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5442775/natal-recognizes-31-body-parts-uses-tenth-of-xbox-360-computing-resources | title = Natal Recognizes 31 Body Parts, Uses Tenth of Xbox 360 "Computing Resources" |date=[tpl]Date|2010-01-07|mdy[/tpl]|accessdate=[tpl]Date|2010-11-25|mdy[/tpl]|publisher=Kotaku, Gawker Media|first=Stephen|last=Totilo[/tpl] which provide full-body 3D motion capture, facial recognition and voice recognition capabilities. At launch, voice recognition was only made available in Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. Mainland Europe received the feature later in spring 2011.[tpl]cite web | url = http://123kinect.com/europe-canada-kinect-voice-spring/ | title = Microsoft: Kinect doesn’t listen in mainland Europe till spring | date=[tpl]Date|2010-09-01|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] Currently voice recognition is supported in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. The Kinect sensor's microphone array enables the Xbox 360 to conduct acoustic source localization and ambient noise suppression, allowing for things such as headset-free party chat over Xbox Live.
The depth sensor consists of an infrared laser projector combined with a monochrome CMOS sensor, which captures video data in 3D under any ambient light conditions. The sensing range of the depth sensor is adjustable, and the Kinect software is capable of automatically calibrating the sensor based on gameplay and the player's physical environment, accommodating for the presence of furniture or other obstacles.

[/tpl] According to information supplied to retailers, Kinect is capable of simultaneously tracking up to six people, including two active players for motion analysis with a feature extraction of 20 joints per player. However, PrimeSense has stated that the number of people the device can "see" (but not process as players) is only limited by how many will fit in the field-of-view of the camera.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/19/kinect-how-it-works-from-the-company-behind-the-tech/|title=Kinect: The company behind the tech explains how it works|date=[tpl]Date|2010-06-19|mdy[/tpl]|accessdate=[tpl]Date|2011-03-21|mdy[/tpl]|publisher=Joystiq[/tpl]
Reverse engineering[tpl]cite web |url=http://git.marcansoft.com/?p=libfreenect.git;a=summary |title=libfreenect open source Kinect driver[/tpl] has determined that the Kinect sensor outputs video at a frame rate of 30 Hz. The RGB video stream uses 8-bit VGA resolution (640 × 480 pixels) with a Bayer color filter, while the monochrome depth sensing video stream is in VGA resolution (640 × 480 pixels) with 11-bit depth, which provides 2,048 levels of sensitivity. The Kinect sensor has a practical ranging limit of [tpl]convert|1.2|-|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] distance when used with the Xbox software. The area required to play Kinect is roughly 6 m2, although the sensor can maintain tracking through an extended range of approximately [tpl]convert|0.7|-|6|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The sensor has an angular field of view of 57° horizontally and 43° vertically, while the motorized pivot is capable of tilting the sensor up to 27° either up or down. The horizontal field of the Kinect sensor at the minimum viewing distance of ~[tpl]convert|0.8|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] is therefore ~[tpl]convert|87|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], and the vertical field is ~[tpl]convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], resulting in a resolution of just over [tpl]convert|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] per pixel.

The depth sensing technology behind Kinect was invented in 2005 by Zeev Zalevsky, Alexander Shpunt, Aviad Maizels and Javier Garcia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/search/en/WO2007043036 |title=The Kinect patent - METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR OBJECT RECONSTRUCTION (2005) |publisher=Wipo.int |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12[/tpl]
Kinect itself was first announced on June 1, 2009 at E3 2009 under the code name "Project Natal".[tpl]cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/109/1096876p1.html |title=E3 2010: Project Natal is "Kinect" |date=[tpl]Date|2010-06-13|mdy[/tpl] |publisher=IGN |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2011-03-18|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] Following in Microsoft's tradition of using cities as code names, "Project Natal" was named after the Brazilian city of Natal as a tribute to the country by Brazilian-born Microsoft director Alex Kipman, who incubated the project. The name Natal was also chosen because the word natal means "of or relating to birth", reflecting Microsoft's view of the project as "the birth of the next generation of home entertainment".

[tpl]Cquote|The first thing to talk about is, Kinect was not actually hacked. Hacking would mean that someone got to our algorithms that sit inside of the Xbox and was able to actually use them, which hasn't happened. Or, it means that you put a device between the sensor and the Xbox for means of cheating, which also has not happened. That's what we call hacking, and that's what we have put a ton of work and effort to make sure doesn't actually occur. What has happened is someone wrote an open-source driver for PCs that essentially opens the USB connection, which we didn't protect, by design, and reads the inputs from the sensor.

== Reception ==

IGN gave the device 7.5 out of 10, saying that "Kinect can be a tremendous amount of fun for casual players, and the creative, controller-free concept is undeniably appealing", though adding that for "$149.99, a motion-tracking camera add-on for the Xbox 360 is a tough sell, especially considering that the entry level variation of the Xbox 360 itself is only $199.99".[tpl]cite web |url=http://gear.ign.com/articles/113/1132213p1.html? |title=Microsoft Kinect Review |first=Scott |last=Lowe |date=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl] |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] Game Informer rated Kinect 8 out of 10, praising the technology but noting that the experience takes a while to get used to and that the spatial requirement[tpl]clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl] may pose a barrier.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/11/03/kinect-hardware-review.aspx |title=Kinect Hardware Review: Wave Of The Future |first=Annette |last=Gonzalez |date=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl] |work= |publisher=Game Informer |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] Computer and Video Games called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls, while criticizing the launch lineup and Kinect Hub.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=273523 |title=Kinect Review |first=Tim |last=Ingham |date=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl] |publisher=Computer and Video Games |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl][/tpl]
CNET's review pointed out how Kinect keeps players active with its full-body motion sensing but criticized the learning curve, the additional power supply needed for older Xbox 360 consoles and the space requirements.[tpl]cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/xbox-360-accessories/xbox-360-kinect/4505-9994_7-34182443.html?tag=cnetRiver#reviewPage1 |title=Xbox 360 Kinect Review |first=Jeff |last=Bakalar |date=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl] |work= |publisher=CNET |accessdate=[tpl]Date|2010-11-04|mdy[/tpl][/tpl] Engadget, too, listed the large space requirements as a negative, along with Kinect's launch lineup and the slowness of the hand gesture UI.
