In physics and chemistry and related fields, a kinetic scheme is a network of states and connections among the states representing the scheme of a dynamical process. Usually, a kinetic scheme represents a Markovian process, where when the process is not Markovian, the scheme is a generalized kinetic scheme. See Fig. 1 for an illustration of a kinetic scheme.

==A Markovian kinetic scheme==

===Description of the form of a kinetic scheme===

===Mathematical description===

===Specific Markovian kinetic schemes===

* A birth-death process is a linear one-dimensional Markovian kinetic scheme.
* Michaelisâ€“Menten kinetics are a type of a Markovian kinetic scheme when solved with the steady state assumption for the creation of intermediates in the reaction pathway.

==Generalizations of Markovian kinetic schemes==

An example for such a process is a reduced dimensions form. 
* The Fokker Planck equation: when expanding the master equation of the kinetic scheme in a continuous space coordinate, one finds the Fokker Planck equation.
