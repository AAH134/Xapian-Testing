LCD Smartie is open-source software for Microsoft Windows which allows an LCD display to be used as a (additional) display device for a PC. Supported devices include the Hitachi HD44780 Controller, the Matrix Orbital Serial/USB LCD, and Palm OS devices (when used in conjunction with PalmOrb).
The project was started as freeware by Basie P who wrote it in delphi. After running the software as freeware from 2001 to late 2004, Basie P quit the project and passed it on to Chris Lansley as an Open Source project hosted on the Sourceforge servers. Chris Lansley maintained the project for few years, and now the whole project remains alive thanks to the program community.
Today, the most active section of the program is the support under its forum pages. The development is not so active, but there are a few users who are releasing new plugins for it from time to time.
