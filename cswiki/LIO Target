LIO Target (linux-iscsi.org) is a multiprotocol SCSI target for Linux. It currently supports fabric modules for iSCSI, Fibre Channel, FCoE, InfiniBand (SRP), USB and Firewire. LIO went upstream into Linux with kernel version 2.6.38,[tpl]cite web| url=http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=38567333a6dabd0f2b4150e9fb6dd8e3ba2985e5| title=Trivial merge| author=Linus Torvalds| publisher=lkml.org| date=2011-01-15| accessdate=2011-03-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-Coming-in-2-6-38-Part-4-Storage-1199926.html| title=Kernel Log: Coming in 2.6.38 (Part 4) - Storage| author=Thorsten Leemhuis| publisher=Heise Online| date=3/2/2011[/tpl] and has become the standard unified block storage target in Linux.  Supported CPU architectures include x86, ia64, ARM, CELL, MIPS and POWER, etc.

==Features==

The LIO SCSI target engine implements a comprehensive SPC-3/SPC-4[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.t10.org/members/w_spc4.htm| title=SCSI Primary Commands - 4 (SPC-4)| author=Ralph Weber| publisher=t10.org| date=2011-01-17| accessdate=2011-03-07[/tpl]  feature set with support for high-end SCSI features in a fabric-agnostic way, such as Persistent Reservations (PR) and Asymmetric Logical Unit Assignment (ALUA). The LIO iSCSI fabric module also implements a number of advanced features, such as Multiple Connections per Session (MC/S) and Error Recovery Level 2 (ERL=2).
LIO has a configfs-based[tpl]cite web| url=http://lwn.net/Articles/148973/| title=Configfs - an introduction| author=Jonathan Corbet| publisher=lwn.net| date=2005-08-24| accessdate=2011-03-07[/tpl] kernel API, and can be managed via a comprehensive command-line interface and API (targetcli). targetci allows unified management of all LIO block storage protocols, such as iSCSI, Fibre Channel, FCoE, InfiniBand, etc. targetcli is dual licensed, and the community edition is available under the AGPL.[tpl]cite web| url=http://linux-iscsi.org/wiki/Targetcli| title=targetcli| accessdate=2/29/2011| publisher=linux-iscsi.org[/tpl]
LIO is being used in a number of commercial storage systems, including Buffalo, Netgear, QNAP, Synology, etc. 
Together with the replication software DRBD and the cluster software Pacemaker, LIO allows the configuration of highly-available storage systems. RTSadmin, the enterprise management platform for LIO, supports easy setup and configuration of such HA arrays.
LIO is being developed by RisingTide Systems, located in the Silicon Valley, which sells storage systems and software.  RisingTide Systems is a member of the Linux Solutions Group (Lisog), where LIO provides the blocklevel storage component for the open source reference stack.

==Architecture==

===Target===

LIO has a modular and extensible architecture. The LIO SCSI target core is independent of specific fabric modules or backstore types.  This way, LIO can support any number of fabrics and backstores, and allows using them together at the same time. 

====Inclusion in Linux====

The LIO modules have gone upstream into the Linux kernel as follows:
* Linux 2.6.38 (2011-03-14[tpl]cite web| url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/14/508| title=Linux 2.6.38| author=Linus Torvalds| date=3/14/2011| publisher=lkml.org[/tpl]): Generic multiprotocol target engine (including all backstores)
* Linux 2.6.39 (2011-05-18[tpl]cite web| url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/19/16| title=Linux 2.6.39| author=Linus Torvalds| date=5/18/2011| publisher=lkml.org[/tpl]): tcm_loop (SPC-3/4 SCSI support for raw block devices)
* Linux 3.0 (2011-07-21[tpl]cite web| url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/21/455| title=Linux 3.0| author=Linus Torvalds| date=7/21/2011| publisher=lkml.org[/tpl]): FCoE (contributed by Cisco)
* Linux 3.1 (2011-10-24[tpl]cite web| url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/24/212| title=Linux 3.1| author=Linus Torvalds| date=10/24/2011| publisher=lkml.org[/tpl]): iSCSI
* Linux 3.3 (2012-03-18[tpl]cite web| url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/18/132| title=Linux 3.3| author=Linus Torvalds| date=3/18/2012| publisher=lkml.org[/tpl]): InfiniBand/SRP[tpl]cite web| url=http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=f59e842fc0871cd5baa213dc32e0ce8e5aaf4758| title=InfiniBand/SRP merge| author=Linus Torvalds| date=1/18/2012| publisher=lkml.org[/tpl] (Mellanox HCAs)
* Linux 3.5 (planned): Fibre Channel (QLogic HBAs), USB Gadget and IEEE 1394

====Inclusion in Linux distributions====

LIO Target is included "out of the box" in most Linux distributions. For the most popular distributions, the initial LIO Target inclusion dates were:
* CentOS: version 6.2, released on 2011-12-20
* Debian: version 7.0 ("wheezy"), frozen in 06-2011
* Fedora: version 16, released on 2011-11-08
* openSUSE: version 12.1, released on 2011-11-16
* RHEL: version 6.2, released on 2011-11-16
* Scientific Linux: version 6.2, released on 2012-02-16
* SLES: version 11 SP2, released on 2012-02-15
* Ubuntu: version 12.04 LTS ("Precise Pangolin"), released on 2012-04-26

===Initiator===

RisingTide Systems also provides an open source iSCSI initiator, called Core-iSCSI. Core-iSCSI supports a number of advanced iSCSI features, including, in particular, Multiple Connections per Session (MC/S) and Error Recovery Level 2 (ERL=2), which the standard Linux Open-iSCSI initiator doesn't support. This way, Core-iSCSI can drive increased availability, scalability and performance.  Core-iSCSI also allows remote boot across an iSCSI SAN or WAN ("diskless boot").
