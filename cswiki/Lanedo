== History ==

It all began in 2003 when Mikael Hallendal and Richard Hult were working together on a project management software called Planner. With a shared passion for development and GTK+, Hallendal and Hult created Imendio was formed.
After 5 years of building up the company, the founders decided they wanted to step back for personal reasons.  The business and people continued in a new company called Lanedo founded by Tim Janik and Martyn Russell in early 2009.
In 2011, Lanedo joined the Documentation Foundation TSC (Task Steering Committee) and became much more involved in the future of LibreOffice.
