== History ==

It all began in 2003 when Mikael Hallendal and Richard Hult were working together on a project management software called Planner. With a shared passion for development and GTK+, Hallendal and Hult created Imendio was formed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
After 5 years of building up the company, the founders decided they wanted to step back for personal reasons.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]  The business and people continued in a new company called Lanedo founded by Tim Janik and Martyn Russell in early 2009.
