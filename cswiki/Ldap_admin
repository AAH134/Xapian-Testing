LDAP Admin is a free, open-source LDAP directory management tool licensed under the GNU General Public License. Small and compact, LDAP Admin is also highly configurable through the use of the template extensions. In addition to common browsing and editing functions, LDAP Admin provides a directory management functionality by supporting a number of application-specific LDAP objects such as Posix and Samba groups and accounts, Postfix objects and a number of Active Directory objects. It also provides an XML-based template engine which extends the application in a seamless way allowing it to support virtually unlimited number of user defined objects.

==Features==

Some of the key features include:
*Browsing and editing of LDAP directories
*Recursive operations on directory trees (copy, move and delete)
*Modify operations on datasets
*Password management
*Management of Posix Groups and Accounts
*Management of Samba Groups and Accounts
*Postfix MTA Support
