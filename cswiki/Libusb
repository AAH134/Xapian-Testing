libusb is a suite of user-mode routines for controlling data transfer to and from USB devices on Unix-like systems without the need for kernel-mode drivers.

==Availability==

Libusb is currently available for Linux, the BSDs and Mac OS X and is written in C. There is also a port to Win32 systems.
Amongst other applications, the library is used by SANE, the Linux scanner project, in preference to the kernel scanner module, which is restricted to Linux kernel 2.4
