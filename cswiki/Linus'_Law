There are two statements named Linus's Law: one by Eric S. Raymond concerning  software bug detection by a community, and the other by Linus Torvalds about the motivations of programmers.

== By Eric Raymond ==

Linus's Law as described by Raymond is a claim about software development, named in honor of Linus Torvalds and formulated by Raymond in his essay and book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" (1999). and also that reviews may be more efficient than testing.
In Facts and Fallacies about Software Engineering, Robert Glass refers to Linus' Law as a "mantra" of the Open source movement, but calls it a fallacy, stating that research has found that the number of bugs found decreases with too many inspectors, and that no research supports  the Law as stated.Howard, Leblanc. p 726.

== By Linus Torvalds ==

In the prologue of the book The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age (2001) Torvalds introduces his "Linus's Law", which is that every motivation that makes a man do something can be classified under "survival", "social life" and "entertainment."  As a result, he writes, progress is defined as reaching a higher category: not doing a thing merely for survival, but for social reasons, and then, even better, just for fun.
