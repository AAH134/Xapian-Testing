Linux adoption refers to new use of the Linux computer operating system by homes, organizations, companies, and governments, while Linux migration refers to the change from using other operating systems to using Linux.
Many factors have resulted in increased use of Linux systems by traditional desktop users as well as operators of server systems, including desire for decreased operating system cost, increased security and support for open-source principles.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/|title = Why Linux is Better|accessdate =15 March 2009|last = Cornet|first = Manu|year = undated[/tpl] Several national governments have passed policies moving governmental computers to Linux from proprietary systems in the last few years.
In August 2010 Jeffrey Hammond, the principal analyst at Forrester Research pronounced: "Linux has crossed the chasm to mainstream adoption." His declaration was based on the huge number of enterprises that had moved to Linux during the late-2000s recession. In a company survey completed in  the third quarter of 2009, 48% of companies surveyed reported using an open source operating system.[tpl]cite web|url = http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3898206/LinuxCon-Analysts-Linux-Is-Winning.htm|title = LinuxCon Analysts: Linux Is Winning|accessdate =12 August 2010|last = Kerner|first = Sean Michael|year = 2010|month = August[/tpl]

The search for alternatives was legally required for any expenditures over Cdn$25,000. The court case was brought by Savoir Faire Linux, a small Montreal-based company that had hoped to bid Linux software to replace the government's aging Windows XP. The judge dismissed the government's contention that Microsoft software was chosen because employees were already familiar with Windows and that switching to a different operating system would have cost more.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2010/06/03/quebec-microsoft-lawsuit.html|title = Quebec broke law in buying Microsoft software|accessdate =3 June 2010|last = Nowak|first = Peter|year = 2010|month = June | work=CBC News[/tpl]

==Linux adopters==

==Types of hardware platforms==

Linux is used on desktop computers, servers and supercomputers, as well as a wide range of devices.

===Desktop computers===

====Measuring desktop adoption====

Because Linux desktop distributions are not usually distributed by retail sale like other operating systems, there are no sales numbers that indicate the number of users. One downloaded file may be used to create many CDs and each CD may be used to install the operating system on multiple computers. On the other hand the file might be used only for a test and the installation erased soon after. Due to these factors estimates of current Linux desktop often rely on webpage hits by computers identifying themselves as running Linux. The use of these statistics has been criticized as unreliable and as underestimating Linux use.[tpl]cite news | first=Ryan | last=Paul | title=Linux market share set to surpass Win 98, OS X still ahead of Vista | date=3 September 2007 | publisher=Ars Technica, LLC | url =http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070903-linux-marketshare-set-to-surpass-windows-98.html | work =Ars Technica | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://counter.li.org/estimates.php|title = Estimating the number of Linux users|accessdate =18 March 2009|last = Linux Counter|year = 2005|month = March[/tpl]
Using webpage hits as a measure, until 2008 Linux accounted for only about 1% of desktop market share, while Microsoft Windows operating systems held more than 90%.[tpl]cite news | first=Peter | last=Galli | title=Vista Aiding Linux Desktop, Strategist Says | date=8 August 2007 | publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise Inc. | url =http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Vista-Aiding-Linux-Desktop-Strategist-Says/ | work =eWEEK | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | first=Stan | last=Beer | title=Vista to play second fiddle to XP until 2009: Gartner | date=23 January 2007 | publisher=iTWire | url =http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/8842/53/ | work =iTWire | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&qpmr=15&qpdt=1&qpct=3&qptimeframe=Y |title=Operating System Marketshare for Year 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |date=19 November 2007 |work=Market Share |publisher=Net Applications [/tpl][tpl]cite news | title=Vista slowly continues its growth; Linux more aggressive than Mac OS during the summer | date=24 September 2007 | publisher=AT Internet/XiTi.com | url =http://www.xitimonitor.com/en-us/internet-users-equipment/operating-systems-august-2007/index-1-2-7-107.html | work =XiTiMonitor | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php |title=Global Web Stats |accessdate=19 November 2007 |date=10 November 2007 |work=W3Counter |publisher=Awio Web Services LLC [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-jun04.html |title=June 2004 Zeitgeist |accessdate=19 November 2007 |date=12 August 2004 |work=Google Press Center |publisher=Google Inc.

According to W3Counter webpage hits the Linux desktop market share increased 62% from 1.32% to 2.13% between mid 2007 and the beginning of 2009, while Windows use fell from 95.52% to 88.77% in the same period, a drop of 7%.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?date=2007-07-30|title = Global Web Stats|accessdate =13 March 2009|last = W3Counter|year = 2007|month = July[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php|title = Global Web Stats|accessdate =13 March 2009|last = W3Counter|year = 2009|month = February[/tpl]
The Linux Counter uses an alternate method of estimating adoption, asking users to register and then using a mathematical model to estimate the total number of desktop users. In March 2009 this method estimated 29 million Linux users.[tpl]cite web|url = http://counter.li.org/|title = The Linux Counter|accessdate =18 March 2009|last = Linux Counter|year = 2009|month = March[/tpl]
In April 2009 Aaron Seigo of KDE indicated that most web-page counter methods produce Linux adoption numbers that are far too low given the system's extensive penetration into non-North American markets, especially China. He stated that the North American-based web-measurement methods produce high Windows numbers and ignore the widespread use of Linux in other parts of the world. In estimating true worldwide desktop adoption and accounting for the Windows-distorted environment in the USA and Canada he indicated that at least 8% of the world desktops run Linux distributions and possibly as high as 10–12% and that the numbers are rising quickly. Other commentators have echoed this same belief, noting that competitors are expending a lot of effort to discredit Linux, which is incongruent with a tiny market share:[tpl]cite web|url = http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3818696_2/Linux-Desktop-Market-Share-Greater-Than-One-Percent.htm|title = Linux Desktop Market Share: Greater Than One Percent?|accessdate =6 May 2009|last = Byfield|first = Bruce|year = 2009|month = May[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://blog.linuxtoday.com/blog/2009/05/1-linux-microso.html|title = Tiny 1% Linux = Big Microsoft Terror|accessdate =30 May 2009|last = Schroder|first = Carla|year = 2009|month = May[/tpl]
In May 2009 Preston Gralla, contributing editor to Computerworld.com, in reacting to the Net Applications web hit numbers showing that Linux use was over 1%, said that "Linux will never become an important desktop or notebook operating system". He reasoned that the upsurge in Linux desktop use recently seen was due to Linux netbooks, a trend he saw as already diminishing and which would be further eroded when Windows 7 became available (and indeed, Linux netbooks did fall by the wayside, though whether they were solely responsible for the upsurge in Linux usage is open to question). He concluded: "As a desktop operating system, Linux isn't important enough to think about. For servers, it's top-notch, but you likely won't use it on your desktop – even though it did finally manage to crack the 1% barrier after 18 years".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=338839|title = Opinion: Why you shouldn't care about Linux on the desktop|accessdate =20 May 2009|last = Gralla|first = Preston|year = 2009|month = May[/tpl]
In 2009 Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer indicated that Linux had a greater desktop market share than Mac, stating that in recent years Linux had "certainly increased its share somewhat". Just under a third of all Dell netbook sales in 2009 had Linux installed.[tpl]cite web|url = http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2010/09/debunking-the-1-myth.html|title = Debunking the 1% Myth|accessdate =14 September 2010|last = Martin|first = Caitlyn|year = 2010|month = September[/tpl]
Caitlyn Martin, researching retail market numbers in the summer of 2010 also concluded that the traditional numbers mentioned for Linux desktop adoption were far too low:

====Reasons for adoption====

Reasons to change from other operating systems to Linux include better system stability, better malware protection, low or no cost, that most distributions come complete with application software and hardware drivers, simplified updates for all installed software, free software licencing, availability of application repositories and access to the source code. Linux desktop distributions also offer multiple desktop workspaces, greater customization, free and unlimited support through forums, and an operating system that doesn't slow down over time. Environmental reasons are also cited, as Linux operating systems usually do not come in boxes and other retail packaging, but are downloaded via the Internet. The lower system specifications also mean that older hardware can be kept in use instead of being recycled or discarded. Linux distributions also get security vulnerabilities patched much more quickly than non-free operating systems and improvements in Linux have been occurring at a faster rate than those in Windows.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntucat/the-linux-desktop-myth/|title = The Linux Desktop Myth|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Siu|first = A.Y.|year = 2006|month = July[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://resources.zdnet.co.uk/articles/features/0,1000002000,39483863-1,00.htm|title = Ten key differences between Linux and Windows|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Wallen|first = Jack.|year = 2008|month = September[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=256|title = Why would anyone choose Windows over Linux?|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Wallen|first = Jack.|year = 2008|month = August[/tpl]
Investments have been made to improve desktop Linux usability since 2007. A report in The Economist in December 2007 said: "Linux has swiftly become popular in small businesses and the home. That’s largely the doing of Gutsy Gibbon, the code-name for the Ubuntu 7.10 from Canonical. Along with distributions such as Linspire, Mint, Xandros, OpenSUSE and gOS, Ubuntu (and its siblings Kubuntu, Edubuntu and Xubuntu) has smoothed most of Linux’s geeky edges while polishing it for the desktop. No question, Gutsy Gibbon is the sleekest, best integrated and most user-friendly Linux distribution yet. It’s now simpler to set up and configure than Windows."[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10410912|title = Technology in 2008|accessdate =1 April 2008 (publicly available December 2007 – May 2009, rendered members only in May 2009, quoted at http://web.ncf.ca/fn352/ubuntu.html#Economist)|last = The Economist|year = 2007|month = December[/tpl]
Indian bulk computer purchaser the Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu (ELCOT) started recommending only Linux in June 2008. Following testing they stated: "ELCOT has been using SUSE Linux and Ubuntu Linux operating systems on desktop and laptop computers numbering over 2,000 during the past two years and found them far superior as compared to other operating systems, notably the Microsoft Operating System."
In many developing nations, such as China, where, due to widespread software piracy, Microsoft Windows can be easily obtained for free, Linux distributions are gaining a high level of adoption. In these countries there is essentially no cost barrier to obtaining proprietary operating systems, but users are adopting Linux based on its merit, rather than on price.
In January 2001, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates explained the attraction of adopting Linux in an internal memo that was released in the Comes vs Microsoft case. He said:
[tpl]quote|Our most potent Operating System competitor is Linux and the phenomena around Open Source and free software. The same phenomena fuels competitors to all of our products. The ease of picking up Linux to learn it or to modify some piece of it is very attractive. The academic community, start up companies, foreign governments and many other constituencies are putting their best work into Linux.[tpl]cite web|url = http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/8000/PX08256.pdf|title = Comes vs Microsoft E-mail Exhibit|accessdate = 29 June 2009|last = Gates|first = Bill|year = 2001|month = January[/tpl] [/tpl]

====Barriers to adoption====

The greatest barrier to Linux desktop adoption is probably that few desktop PCs come with it from the factory. A.Y. Siu asserted in 2006 that most people use Windows simply because most PCs come with Windows pre-installed; they didn't choose it. Linux has much lower market penetration because in most cases users have to install it themselves, a task that is beyond the capabilities of many PC users: "Most users won’t even use Windows restore CDs, let alone install Windows from scratch. Why would they install an unfamiliar operating system on their computers?"
TechRepublic writer Jack Wallen expands on this barrier, saying in August 2008:
In an openSUSE survey conducted in 2007, 69.5% of respondents said they dual booted a Microsoft Windows operating system in addition to a Linux operating system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/6/6c/Opensuse_survey_102_data_final.pdf |title=openSUSE 10.2 Survey Results |accessdate=19 November 2007 |date=4 May 2007 |format=PDF |work=openSUSE |publisher=openSUSE [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] In early 2007 Bill Whyman, an analyst at Precursor Advisors, noted that "there still isn't a compelling alternative to the Microsoft infrastructure on the desktop."[tpl]cite news | first=Robert A. | last=Guth | title=Linux Starts to Find Home on Desktops | date=13 March 2007 | publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc. | url =http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB117374336173334742-lMyQjAxMDE3NzEzMzcxNDMzWj.html | work =The Wall Street Journal Online | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl]
Application support, the quality of peripheral support, and end user support were at one time seen as the biggest obstacles to desktop Linux adoption. According to a 2006 survey by The Linux Foundation, these factors were seen as a "major obstacle" for 56%, 49%, and 33% of respondents respectively at that time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;1462899608;fp;4194304;fpid;1 |title=Living (and dying) with Linux in the workplace |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Machlis |first=Sharon |date=22 March 2007 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG Communications [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=420 |title=Five crucial things the Linux community doesn’t understand about the average computer user |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Kingsley-Hughes |first=Adrian |date=21 May 2007 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc.

By 2008 the design of Linux applications and the porting of Windows and Apple applications had progressed to the point where it was difficult to find an application that did not have an equivalent for Linux, providing adequate or better capabilities.[tpl]cite web|url = http://linuxappfinder.com/alternatives|title = Windows and OS X Software Alternatives|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Linux App Finder |year = 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.tuxsoftware.com/home/|title = Linux Software Search|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = TuxSoftware.com|year = undated |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822001523/http://www.tuxsoftware.com/home/ |archivedate = 22 August 2008[/tpl]
An example of application progress can be seen comparing the main productivity suite for Linux, OpenOffice.org, to Microsoft Office.

=====Peripheral support=====

In the past the availability and quality of open source device drivers were issues for Linux desktops. Particular areas which were lacking drivers included printers as well as wireless and audio cards.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.linux-foundation.org/images/3/3b/DTL_Survey_Report_Nov2005.pdf |title=2005 Desktop Linux Client Survey Report |accessdate=19 November 2007 |year=2005 |format=PDF |work=OSDL Desktop Linux Working Group |publisher=Linux Foundation [/tpl] For example in early 2007, Dell did not sell specific hardware and software with Ubuntu 7.04 computers, including printers, projectors, Bluetooth keyboards and mice, TV tuners and remote controls, desktop modems and Blu-ray disc drives, due to incompatibilities at that time, as well as legal issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&dl=false&l=en&s=gen&docid=33C0764C597FC6CCE040A68F5B2872A3&doclang=en |title=Hardware and Software Not Sold on Dell Ubuntu 7.04 Computers |accessdate=19 November 2007 |date=26 July 2007 |work=Dell USA |publisher=Dell [/tpl]
By 2008 most Linux hardware support and driver issues had been adequately addressed. In September 2008 Jack Wallen's assessment was:

=====End-user support=====

Some critics have stated that compared to Windows, Linux is lacking in end-user support. Linux has traditionally been seen as requiring much more technical expertise.[tpl]cite news | first=Walter S. | last=Mossberg | title=Linux's Free System Is Now Easier to Use, But Not for Everyone | date=13 September 2007 | publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc. | url =http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118963540721725614-FnJzx_wcNlkRFOef4cgq74PBW3g_20080912.html?mod=rss_personal_technology | work =The Wall Street Journal Online | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/software/190900617 |title=A Linux OS For All |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Ohlhorst |first=Frank J. |date=21 July 2006 |work=CRN |publisher= CMP Media LLC [/tpl] Dell's website describes open source software as requiring intermediate or advanced knowledge to use. In September 2007, the founder of the Ubuntu project, Mark Shuttleworth, commented that "it would be reasonable to say that this is not ready for the mass market."
In October 2004 Chief Technical Officer of Adeptiva Linux, Stephan February, noted at that time that Linux was a very technical software product, and few people outside the technical community were able to support consumers. Windows users are able to rely on friends and  family for help, but Linux users generally use discussion boards, which can be uncomfortable for consumers.[tpl]cite news | first=Geoffrey P. | last=Ramos | title=Linux not ready for mass market | date=29 October 2004 | publisher=IDG | url =http://www.techworld.com/opsys/news/index.cfm?NewsID=2510 | work =Techworld | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=424 |title=Three more things that the Linux community doesn’t get |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Kingsley-Hughes |first=Adrian |date=23 May 2007 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc.

More recently critics have found that the Linux user support model, using community-based forum support, has greatly improved. In 2008 Jack Wallen stated:

Linux's credibility has also been under attack at times, but as Ron Miller of LinuxPlanet points out:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/5401/1/ |title=Linux Criticism Revs Up |accessdate=19 November 2007 |last=Miller |first=Ron |date=20 May 2004 |work=LinuxPlanet |publisher=Jupitermedia Corporation [/tpl]

with Gartner warning in 2005 that the costs of migration may exceed the cost benefits of Linux.[tpl]cite news | first=Andy | last=McCue | title=Gartner sounds desktop Linux warning | date=9 September 2005 | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. | url =http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39217113,00.htm | work =silicon.com | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl] Gartner reiterated the warning in 2008, predicting that "by 2013, a majority of Linux deployments will have no real software total cost of ownership (TCO) advantage over other operating systems." Organizations that have moved to Linux have disagreed with these warnings. Sterling Ball, CEO of Ernie Ball, the world's leading maker of premium guitar strings and a 2003 Linux adopter, said of total cost of ownership arguments: "I think that's propaganda...What about the cost of dealing with a virus? We don't have 'em...There's no doubt that what I'm doing is cheaper to operate. The analyst guys can say whatever they want."Rockin' on without Microsoft | Newsmakers | CNET News.com
In the SCO-Linux controversies, the SCO Group had alleged that UNIX source code donated by IBM was illegally incorporated into Linux. The threat that SCO might be able to legally assert ownership of Linux initially caused some potential Linux adopters to delay that move. The court cases bankrupted SCO in 2007 after it lost its four-year court battle over the ownership of the UNIX copyrights. SCO's case had hinged on showing that Linux included intellectual property that had been misappropriated from UNIX, but the case failed when the court discovered that Novell and not SCO was the rightful owner of the copyrights. During the legal process, it was revealed that SCO's claims about Linux were fraudulent and that SCO's internal source code audits had showed no evidence of infringement.[tpl]cite web|url = http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/01/sco-aims-to-reorganize-fight-on-with-corporate-garage-sale.ars|title = SCO aims to reorganize, fight on with corporate garage sale|accessdate =19 March 2009|last = Paul|first = Ryan|year = 2009|month = January[/tpl]
A rival operating system vendor, Green Hills Software, has called the open source paradigm of Linux "fundamentally insecure".[tpl]cite news | first=Alexander | last=Wolfe | title=Green Hills calls Linux 'insecure' for defense | date=4 September 2004 | publisher=CMP Media LLC | url =http://www.eetimes.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=18900949 | work =EE Times | accessdate =19 November 2007 [/tpl]
The US Army does not agree that Linux is a security problem. Brigadier General Nick Justice, the Deputy Program Officer for the Army's Program Executive Office, Command, Control and Communications Tactical (PEO C3T), said in April 2007:

===Servers===

Linux became popular in the Internet server market particularly due to the LAMP software bundle. In September 2008 Steve Ballmer (Microsoft CEO) claimed 60% of servers run Linux and 40% run Windows Server.[ref]

===Devices===

Linux is often used in various single- or multi-purpose computer appliances and embedded systems.The Linux Devices Showcase For instance Google's Android mobile operating system, Nokia's Maemo and HP's WebOS mobile operating system run on the Linux kernel.[tpl]cite web |title=Overview of webOS |url=http://developer.palm.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1761&Itemid=42 |publisher=Palm, Inc. |accessdate=25 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl]

==Advocacy==

Many organizations advocate for Linux adoption. The foremost of these is the Linux Foundation which hosts and sponsors the key kernel developers, manages the Linux trademark, manages the Open Source Developer Travel Fund, provides legal aid to open source developers and companies through the Linux Legal Defense Fund, sponsors kernel.org and also hosts the Patent Commons Project.
The International Free and Open Source Software Foundation (iFOSSF) is a nonprofit organization based in Michigan, USA dedicated to accelerating and promoting the adoption of FOSS worldwide through research and civil society partnership networks.
The Open Invention Network was formed to protect vendors and customers from patent royalty fees while using OSS.
Other advocates for Linux include:
*IBM through its Linux Marketing Strategy
*Linux User Groups
*Asian Open Source Centre (AsiaOSC)
