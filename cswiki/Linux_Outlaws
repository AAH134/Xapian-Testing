==Format==

Each episode generally has a global download count of over 20000 and is often presented with both a serious attitude and a humorous bent.. The presenters claim not to be Linux experts, but only to be trying very hard to provide listeners with a good time, entertainment, and interesting Linux-related information.
Linux Outlaws is segment-based, and focuses the show on discussion of various topics throughout the show. Regular features include News and Releases, a look at recent development in free culture and at new releases of Linux distributions and occasionally notable piece of free software. Episode 43 saw the introduction of a Micro-watch sub-segment, concentrating on Microsoft-related news.. The Linux Outlaws show aims to broadcast live on ustream.tv most Monday nights (7 p.m. UTC), but they are always late.
In-Depth Topics and Listener Feedback includes content from both presenters and listeners. Other segments include Tip of the Week and Beer of the Week, where Fabian recommends a brand of beer.
On occasion some shows are produced as specials to focus on one single topic, including the release of Ubuntu 8.04 and an interview with Bradley M. Kuhn..

==History==

The first episode of Linux Outlaws was September 5, 2007. At the time both Dan and Fab were also hosting another Podcast "Rathole radio" http://www.feebleforce.com/rathole. As Stefano Forenza says on his website "you know youâ€™re someone when you get cited 2 times in a single episode of LinuxOutlaws".   Dan revived the name Rat Hole Radio as a music podcast in 2009.

==Production==

Linux Outlaws is recorded simultaneously by the presenters in their respective homes - Bonn, Germany and Merseyside, England - and published in both the Ogg Vorbis and MP3 formats. The process involves recordings made by each presenter on his own machine, as well as a backup analogue recording by Fabian. Recordings are usually made on Monday in a live show, using IRC and releases of the show usually occur on Wednesday. Some changes in schedule may occur when a special show is released, such as an interview.
