Linux adopters are organizations and individuals who have moved from other operating systems to Linux. Although Linux's status as a mainstream operating system is relatively recent, it is in use in many different environments, including government, education, home, business and scientific institutions.

==Government==

As local governments come under pressure from institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the International Intellectual Property Alliance, some have turned to Linux and other Free Software as an affordable, legal alternative to both pirated software and expensive proprietary  computer products from Microsoft, Apple and other commercial companies.
The spread of Linux affords some leverage for these countries when companies from the developed world bid for government contracts (since a low-cost option exists), while furnishing an alternative path to development for countries like India and Pakistan that have many citizens skilled in computer applications but cannot afford technological investment at "First World" prices.

==Education==

Linux is often used in technical disciplines at universities and research centres.  This is due to several factors, including that Linux is available free of charge and includes a large body of free/open source software.  To some extent, technical competence of computer science and software engineering academics is also a contributor, as is stability, maintainability, and upgradability.  IBM ran an advertising campaign entitled "Linux is Education" featuring a young boy who was supposed to be "Linux".YouTube - IBM Linux ad: Prodigy
Examples of large scale adoption of Linux in education include the following:
* The OLPC XO-1 (previously called the MIT $100 laptop and The Children's Machine), is an inexpensive laptop running Linux, which will be distributed to millions of children as part of the One Laptop Per Child project, especially in developing countries.

*The University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom has deployed a "cost effective" high performance computer that will be used to analyse data from telescopes around the world, run simulations and test the current theories about the universe. Its operating system is Scientific Linux. Dr David Bacon of the University of Portsmouth said: "Our Institute of Cosmology is in a great position to use this high performance computer to make real breakthroughs in understanding the universe, both by analysing the very latest astronomical observations, and by calculating the consequences of mind-boggling new theories...By selecting Dell’s industry-standard hardware and open source software we’re able to free up budget that would have normally been spent on costly licences and reinvest it."[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/open-source/3273987/universe-studying-linux-supercomputer-powered-up/|title = Universe studying Linux supercomputer powered up|accessdate = 17 April 2011|last = Savvas|first = Anthony|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = April[/tpl]
