Google has a tradition of perpetrating hoaxes, especially on April Fools' Day, as well as various easter eggs.

== Easter Eggs ==

Google has added many Easter eggs to its products and services.

=== Calculator ===

*The Calculator accepts many humorous units of measurement, including the Beard-second (5 nm), Potrzebie (2.2633 mm), Smoot (5 ft, 7 inches), ngogn (11.5938151 ml), blintz (36.4253863 g), donkeypower (250.033167 W), the prefix hella- (10^27), etc.
*The Calculator recognizes a number of strings as numbers. They can be entered by themselves or used in expressions. They must be entered without quotation marks. When used in an expression, the phrases must be entered in lowercase. In addition to mathematical and scientific constants like pi, e and Avogadro's number the Calculator also accepts:
**"the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything" equals 42 as does "the answer to life, the universe, and everything", a reference to Douglas Adams's novel  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The same reference is made when speaking to an artificial intelligence named Meliza next to "the face on Mars" in Google Earth.  When the number 42 is typed, the AI produces the output "42 is the answer to the ultimate question about life, the universe, and everything."
**"the loneliest number" equals "1", a reference to the song by Harry Nilsson.
**"the number of horns on a unicorn" equals "1".
**"once in a blue moon" equals "1.16699016 × 10−8 hertz".
**"a bakers dozen" equals "13".

=== Search ===

Various Google services also hide Easter eggs meant to be amusing entertainment.
*Searching for "anagram" shows "Did you mean: nag a ram".
*Searching for "do a barrel roll" or "Z or R twice" will rotate the results page a full 360 degrees. This is a reference to the Nintendo video game Star Fox 64. 
*Searching for "recursion" shows "Did you mean: "recursion", which allows you to recursively run searches for recursion.
*Searching for "Jason Isaacs" shows "Hello to Jason Isaacs", a reference to Kermode and Mayo's Film Reviews which greets Jason Isaacs with a 'hello' every week
*Before and during the span of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, searching for various terms which Google has statistics related to, such as "world cup", "world cup usa vs england", or "world cup brazil", causes the result index at the bottom of the page to read as "Gooooooooooal!" instead of "Goooooooooogle".Gooooooal! Easter Egg From Google, Gone Googling. Accessed June 10, 2010.
*Searching for "tilt" or "askew" using a Webkit based browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Android/iOS built-in browsers) or a recent version of Firefox (7+), makes the page 'lean' to the right a bit. 
*Searching for "lgbt" will display a rainbow banner under the search box. 
*Around December 2011 and January 2012, Searching for "let it snow" simulates snowfall and frost on the search results. After a while, the search screen fogs up and the blue search button changes to Defrost, enabling the user to defrost the page clicking and rubbing it like a window. Interaction with the actual search screen is disabled until the Defrost button is pressed (even if the entire screen is manually defrosted). Search screen will cease to fog up once the Defrost button is pressed.
*Searching for "hanukkah" changes the border between the search bar and search results into a row of lights shaped like the Star of David.
*Searching for "santa claus", "christmas lights", "12 days of christmas", "father christmas", "candy cane","merry christmas" or "christmas" changes the border between the search bar and search results into a row of Christmas lights.
*Searching for "kwanzaa" changes the border between the search bar and search results into a row of Kinara
*Searching for "kerning" or "keming" changes the letter-spacing of the word "kerning" or "keming", respectively.
*Searching for "binary" changes the number of found results to read out in binary, unless personal results are found. This also works with other number systems such as "hexadecimal" and "octal".  
*Searching for "qingming festival" (or 清明节) returns a search page containing a stylized tree in the top right, water buffalo in the bottom right, and a jumping koi when the page is clicked.
*Searching for "zerg rush" returns a search page with 'O's eating the search results. Clicking each 'O' a few times kills it. This is a reference to an early attack known as a 'zergling rush' in the Blizzard game Starcraft. After all links have been destroyed, the 'O's form the letters GG in reference to the standard end of game formality and means good game.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/9231157/Googles-Zerg-Rush-game-results-in-page-destroying-mayhem.html|title=Google's Zerg Rush game results in page-destroying mayhem|last=Titcomb|first=James|date=2012-04-27|publisher=The Telegraph|language=English|accessdate=27 April 2012[/tpl]

=== Google Maps/Earth ===

*In early versions of Google Maps, searching for a route between locations separated by expanses of water (e.g. Paris and New York) provided road directions to the coast of the destination country (in this case, the west coast of France) before suggesting "Swim the Atlantic Ocean (3,500 miles)" or another ocean for a different distance. You can now achieve a similar effect by asking Google Maps for directions across the Pacific Ocean, which will return "Kayak across the Pacific Ocean (2,756 miles)." This route includes a short stretch via land across Hawaii.
* If you ask for walking directions from China to Japan at Step 275 it will state "Jet ski across the Pacific Ocean"
* The measurement tool in Google Earth allows users to measure distance in smoots, a unit of length derived from a tradition at MIT. Smoots are also recognized by Google calculator: 1 smoot in m gives the result 1 smoot = 1.7018 meters.
* On Google Earth, tapping out Ctrl+Alt+A would open a flight simulator feature. This is also available through the menu bar. This is not actually a hoax, just an app provided in Google Earth.
* Going on Google Street View, and heading to the rear of the company's Googleplex headquarters in Mountain View, California, the Google Street View's production team can be seen.
* Google Earth's search example is the Google Inc. headquarters (37 25' 19.1"N, 122 05' 06"W).
* Dragging the Google Street View "Peg man" onto Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, CA used to display him with a tie-dyed shirt. He is also given special clothing for some widely observed special occasions: for Halloween he rides a broomstick; for Valentine's Day he stands upon a heart; and during Christmas week, he becomes a snowman.[tpl]cite web|last=Spring |first=Tom |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/142620/googles_top_17_easter_eggs_gags_and_hoaxes.html |title=Google's Top 17 Easter Eggs, Gags, and Hoaxes |publisher=PCWorld |date=March 18, 2008 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl] When dragged into Lego Land in Carlsbad, the "Peg Man" turns into a Lego man. When dragged into Street View in Sun Valley, Idaho, he becomes a skier.
* The Mars Feature of Google Earth allows you to speak to a primitive ELIZA clone on the planet, by searching for "Meliza".[tpl]cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/02/chat-with-martian-in-google-earth-5.html |title=Chat With a Martian in Google Earth 5 |publisher=Googlesystem.blogspot.com |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]
*There is a photo spot on the northern point of Antarctica that is slightly larger than the others. When the man is dragged on this spot, the man turns into a penguin and you can explore the area the same as a road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=-62.594036,-59.894441&spn=0,7.13562&z=8&layer=c&cbll=-62.594036,-59.894441&panoid=eeRNKOk-Naal3wO77OhWXA&cbp=12,0.28,,0,29.18|title=Google Street View Antarctica Penguin|accessdate=Jan 25, 2011[/tpl]
*Searching for "Niniane kicks ass" in Google Maps used to direct to the tech firm's headquarters in Mountain View, California, where an engineering manager called Niniane Wang worked until 2009.[tpl]cite news|last=Moore|first=Matthew|title=Google easter eggs: 15 best hidden jokes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6201814/Google-easter-eggs-15-best-hidden-jokes.html|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=November 7, 2011|location=London|date=September 17, 2009[/tpl]
*Another 3D buildings easter egg involves the famous bridge jump scene from The Blues Brothers, which is recreated in Google Earth at the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge linking New Jersey and Philadelphia.
* In Google Maps, when "The Shire" or "Rivendell" is entered as the start point and "Mordor" as the destination and the walking directions button is clicked, the directions return the warning: "Use caution – One does not simply walk into Mordor."[tpl]cite web|url=http://presurfer.blogspot.com/2011/12/google-maps-lord-of-rings-easter-egg.html |title=The Presurfer: Google Maps 'Lord Of The Rings' Easter Egg |publisher=Presurfer.blogspot.com |date=December 21, 2011 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=rivendell&daddr=mordor&hl=en&ll=56.690933,-4.463196&spn=2.141949,5.984802&sll=56.68952,-4.41573&sspn=2.142035,5.984802&geocode=FT2kWAMdiyXJ_yHURULiW_H8Jg;FVl2aQMdmrKs_ykPwLhiqJaOSDEWTVf874Hujw&vpsrc=0&dirflg=w&mra=ltm&t=m&z=9 |title=Rivendell to mordor – Google Maps |publisher=Google |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]
* On July 20, 2005, the 36th anniversary of the first human landing on the moon, Google debuted a version of Google Maps that included a small segment of the surface of the moon. It is based entirely on NASA images and includes only a very limited region. Panning causes the map to tile. The map also gives the locations of all moon landings, and the Google Moon FAQ humorously mentions a connection to the Google Copernicus hoax, which Google claimed to be developing. Supposedly, by 2069, Google Local will support all lunar businesses and addresses. Zooming to the closest level in Google Moon used to show that the moon was made of cheese.[tpl]cite web|last=Haines |first=Lester |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/20/google_moon/ |title=Google finds sense of humor on surface of Moon |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=July 20, 2005 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]

=== Google.com homepage ===

* Pressing the "I'm feeling lucky" bar without any text shows all of the variations on the "Google" logo throughout the years.
* In December 2009, Google added an easter egg on their homepage whereby clicking the "I'm Feeling Lucky" box with no text entered brings up a clock counting down the seconds until 2010. When it reached zero it displayed "Happy New Year" in fireworks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
*In December 2009 when typing in a search term including the word "Christmas" the line separating the sponsored links from the normal search is replaced with Christmas lights. Also, when typing in a search term including the word "Hanukkah" the line separating the sponsored links is replaced with a Dreidel design.
*Searching for the word "Askew" or "tilt" will turn the entire search page clockwise slightly.
*From May 21–23, 2010, Google replaced its usual homepage with a playable Google-style Pac-man game to celebrate its 30th anniversary. By pressing Insert Coin (which replaced the "I'm feeling lucky" button) multiple times, users could also play a 2-player Ms. Pacman version (moving in WASD). The game is still playable here http://google.com/pacman. 
*Searching for the term "do a barrel roll" will make the result "do a barrel roll."

=== Google Mail ===

* On the Suggest a feature page for Gmail, it shows "Have Gmail do the laundry" as a suggestion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mail.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=suggestions.cs |title=Suggest a feature for Gmail – Gmail Help |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 1, 2010[/tpl]
* Above the list of emails in Gmail, there is normally an ad, except in the spam folder, where there is instead a link to a recipe containing SPAM™.

=== Google Translate ===

*Go to translate.google.com/translate_buttons and drag the word English (if your computer is in English) into your bookmark bar and then click on it. It will load the page with a very old retro kind of logo.
*Go to translate.google.com and set 'translate from' to English. By pasting "pv zk bschk" at the beginning of the string to be translated, the translator will be changed to a "beatbox" mode. The tooltip which shows when the cursor is held over the speaker icon, will now show "beatbox" rather than "listen". Various combinations of consonants typed into the translator after the initial string will result in a beatbox output rather than the usual speech narrator output.   Note that there are other languages besides English which may be chosen for the beatbox mode to be operable, though the choice seems random. For example, Albanian, Armenian, and Belarusian will work, but not Azerbajaini or Basque.

=== Other ===

* Pressing control-shift-y in Picasa will cause a teddybear to appear on the screen.[tpl]cite web|author=March 13, 2010 by Amy-Mae Elliott 369 |url=http://mashable.com/2010/03/13/google-easter-eggs/ |title=5 Must-See Google Easter Eggs |publisher=Mashable.com |date=March 13, 2010 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]
* Pressing the keys "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A" in Google's Feed reader will cause the screen to turn blue and a ninja to appear on the left.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6201814/Google-easter-eggs-15-best-hidden-jokes.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Google easter eggs: 15 best hidden jokes | first=Matthew | last=Moore | date=September 17, 2009[/tpl]  It also causes the phrase "Ninja!" to appear in the search box.
* Google offers services in many languages, including several uncommon ones like Swedish Chef's Bork bork bork, Pig Latin, Hacker (usually known as 1337sp34k), Elmer Fudd, Klingon and Pirate.
* Taking the term Easter egg literally (and perhaps to celebrate the Easter holiday), Google has an official Easter Eggs page.
* If one sets the iGoogle theme to the "Beach" option, then at 3:14 am every morning, the Loch Ness Monster surfaces for 1 minute, then at 3:15 dives back under. The reason for the timing of 3:14 is rumoured to be a tribute to the number pi. Additional 3:14 eggs include the "Seasonal Scape" showing off the Northern Lights, the "City Scape" with UFOs, the "Spring Scape" with a monster, the "Sweet Dreams" with the stars aligning to the shape of the symbol pi, and the "Tea House" that has spirits in the mist.
* In Chrome, Google's Web browser, entering "about:internets" into the address bar brings up a copy of the Windows Screen Saver 3D Pipes, with the title "Don't Clog the Tubes".  In the event that this does not occur due to the fact that the screensaver file does not exist in the system, the browser will instead display a gray screen with the title "The Tubes are Clogged!" This has been removed as of the 2.0.169.1 release.
* The Google Gears Firefox add-on description line reads "These are the gears that power the tubes! :-)". Google Chrome's gears.dll's description also reads "These are the gears that power the tubes! :-)".
** The above two easter eggs allude to former Senator Ted Stevens' "series of tubes" speech on the Senate floor.
* During the course of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, YouTube had a button shaped like a soccer ball in certain videos that plays a recurring vuvuzela sound throughout the video.
* In Google's iPhone and iPod touch search application, swiping downwards (past About) repeatedly in the Settings interface brings up a hidden menu item, called Bells and Whistles, allowing customization of colors, sounds and more within the app. This is now standard on the newest update.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cultofmac.com/google-reveals-hidden-menu-in-iphone-app/6570 |title=Google Reveals Hidden Menu in iPhone App |publisher=Cult of Mac |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]
* In YouTube, holding down the left and up arrow while pausing or watching a video will cause a game of Snake to launch. This is actually a result of two steps; pressing the up arrow while a video is loading launches the game, while pressing the left arrow forces the video to rewind and load momentarily, thus allowing the game to launch.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZVXnbiz8f8&NR=1 |title=Youtube's Easter Egg: The game of snake |work=Youtube |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]
* In YouTube during December 2011, a button was added which, when clicked, caused animated snow to fall from the top of the video.
* In Google Voice, once a text-message being typed exceeds 320 characters ( 2 x 160-per-SMS), the countdown changes to "Really?"
* A 500 Internal server error on YouTube will cause this message to appear: 'A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with this situation. If you see them, show them this information:' followed by a random code.
* In Google Docs, within a spreadsheet, pressing Shift+F12 brings up a message: "Dragon slain! Congratulations, you've slain the dragon!".
* In YouTube, adding &wadsworth=1 to the URL will apply Wadsworth's constant, skipping the first 30% of the video.[tpl]cite web|last=Whitson|first=Gordon|title=Skip Past the Boring Intro on YouTube Videos with the Wadsworth Constant Bookmarklet|url=http://lifehacker.com/5849342/skip-past-the-boring-intro-on-youtube-videos-with-the-wadsworth-constant-bookmarklet|publisher=Lifehacker|accessdate=April 1, 2012|date=October 13, 2011[/tpl]

Google reveals the technology behind its PageRank Systems—PigeonRank. Google touts the benefits of this cost-effective and efficient means of ranking pages and reassures readers that there is no animal cruelty involved in the process. The article makes many humorous references and puns based on computer terminology and how Google PageRank really works, (for example, a chart showing the pigeons' consumption of linseed and flax, represented as "Lin/Ax Kernels," a pun on the Linux kernel).graphs3.gif[tpl]dead link|date=April 2012[/tpl]

Fictitious job opportunities for a research center on the moon. Luna/X (a pun to Linux and the Latin word for moon, as well as a reference to both the Windows XP visual style and Mac OS X) is the name of a new operating system they claimed to have created for working at the research center.

=== 2005 [tpl]anchor|Google Gulp[/tpl] ===

Google Gulp, a fictitious drink, was announced by Google in 2005. According to the company, this beverage would optimize one's use of the Google search engine by increasing the drinker's intelligence. It was claimed this boost was achieved through real-time analysis of the user's DNA and carefully tailored adjustments to neurotransmitters in the brain (a patented technology termed Auto-Drink; as the "Google Gulp FAQ" suggests, partly through MAO inhibition).  The drink was said to come in "4 great flavors":  Glutamate Grape (glutamic acid), Sugar-Free Radical (free radicals), Beta Carroty (beta carotene), and Sero-Tonic Water (serotonin).[tpl]cite web|title=Google hoax's|url=http://www.elevatelocal.co.uk/blog/a-history-of-googles-hoaxes-26015978|publisher=Elevatelocal[/tpl] 
This hoax was probably intended as a parody of Google's then invite-only email service called Gmail. Although ostensibly free, the company claimed the beverage could only be obtained by returning the cap of a Google Gulp bottle to a local grocery store: a causal loop. In the Google Gulp FAQ, Google replies to the observation "I mean, isn't this whole invite-only thing kind of bogus?" by saying "Dude, it's like you've never even heard of viral marketing."

=== 2006 ===

On April Fool's Day 2006, Google Romance was announced on the main Google search page with the introduction, "Dating is a search problem. Solve it with Google Romance." It pretends to offer a "Soulmate Search" to send users on a "Contextual Date". A parody of online dating, it had a link for "those who generally favor the 'throw enough stuff at the wall' approach to online dating" to Post multiple profiles with a bulk upload file, you sleaze in addition to Post your Google Romance profile. Clicking on either of these gave an error page, which explained that it was an April Fool's joke and included links to previous April Fool's jokes.

==== Gmail Paper ====

At about 10:00 pm, Pacific time (where Google has its headquarters) on March 30, 2007, Google changed the login page for Gmail to announce a new service called Gmail Paper. The service offered to allow users of Google's free webmail service to add e-mails to a "Paper Archive", which Google would print (on "96% post-consumer organic soybean sputum") and mail via traditional post. The service would be free, supported by bold, red advertisements printed on the back of the printed messages. Image attachments would also be printed on high-quality glossy paper, though MP3 and WAV files would not be printed. The page detailing more information about the service features photographs of Ian Spiro and Carrie Kemper, current employees of Google. Also featured are Product Marketing Managers of Gmail Anna-Christina Douglas, and Shane Lawrence

==== Google TiSP ====

Google TiSP (short for Toilet Internet Service Provider) was a fictitious free broadband service supposedly released by Google. This service would make use of a standard toilet and sewage lines to provide free Internet connectivity at a speed of 8 Mbit/s (2 Mbit/s upload) (or up to 32 Mbit/s with a paid plan). The user would drop a weighted end of a long, Google-supplied fiber-optic cable in their toilet and flush it. Around 60 minutes later, the end would be recovered and connected to the Internet by a "Plumbing Hardware Dispatcher (PHD)". The user would then connect their end to a Google-supplied wireless router and run the Google-supplied installation media on a Windows XP or Windows Vista computer ("Mac and Linux support coming soon"). Alternatively, a user could request a professional installation, in which Google would deploy nanobots through the plumbing to complete the process. The free service would be supported by "discreet DNA sequencing" of "personal bodily output" to display online ads that relate to culinary preferences and personal health. Google also referenced the diet coke-and-Mentos reaction in their FAQ: "If you're still experiencing problems, drop eight mints into the bowl and add a two-liter bottle of diet soda."

==== Blogger "Google Weblogs (beta)" ====

The Blogger dashboard featured an announcement for Google Weblogs, or "GWeblogs," or "Gblogs," the next revolution in personal publishing. Features include algorithms putting your best content at the top of your blog (rather than publishing by reverse chronology), automatically populating your blog's sidebar with the most relevant content, posting directly into Google search results for maximum visibility, blog headers refreshed with images from Google's team of artists for anniversaries of a scientific achievement (similar to Google Doodle), and automatic content generation ('Unsure of what to post about? Just click "I'm Feeling Lucky" and we'll "take care" of the rest!')
The announcement was followed by a link to a video tour of the product, which actually led to Tay Zonday's cover of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up."

==== Gmail Custom Time ====

Gmail's sign-in page and a banner at the top of each Gmail inbox announced a new feature, called Gmail Custom Time, that would allow its users to "pre-date" their messages and choose to have the message appear as "read" or "unread". The new feature uses the slogan "Be on time. Every time."
Around 11:00 pm EST March 31, 2008, on the newer and older version of Gmail, but not in the basic HTML version, in the upper right corner, next to Settings, a link appeared labeled, "New! Gmail Custom Time". The link led to a 404 error until April 1,[tpl]cite web|last=Domingo |first=Ricky |url=http://sundaycontingency.com/2008/03/gmail-custom-time.html |title=Gmail Custom Time |publisher=Sunday Contingency |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-ABCs/browse_thread/thread/ef1ee6ff59a95370/ec7d837a36782069 |title=Gmail Custom Time – The ABCs of Gmail |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl] when it led to the full Gmail Custom Time hoax page.[tpl]cite web|url=https://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html |title=Gmail: Google's approach to email |publisher=Google |date=April 1, 2004 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl] Clicking any of the three links at the bottom of the page brought the user to a page stating that Gmail Custom time was, in fact, their April Fool's Day joke.
Google wrote that the new joke feature "utilizes an e-flux capacitor pun from the film Back to the Future to resolve issues of causality." Fake testimonials were given by "beta users"; one example is, "I used to be an honest person; but now I don't have to be. It's just so much easier this way. I've gained a lot of productivity by not having to think about doing the 'right' thing."
The feature only allowed for ten pre-dated emails per year, claiming that any more "would cause people to lose faith in the accuracy of time, thus rendering the feature useless."

==== Google Wake Up Kit ====

Google launched their "Wake Up Kit" as a calendar notification option.
 The 'wake up' notification uses several progressively more annoying alerts to wake you up. First it will send an SMS message to your phone. If that fails, more coercive means will be used.

In addition, a bed-flipping device is included for forceful removal from your sleeping quarters.

==== Virgle ====

Google announces a joint project with the Virgin Group to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. This operation has been named Project Virgle. The announcement includes videos of Richard Branson (founder of Virgin Group) as well as Larry Page and Sergey Brin (the founders of Google) on YouTube, talking about Virgle.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/projectvirgle |title=Virgle's YouTube page |work=Youtube |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl] An "application" to join the settlement includes questions such as:
I am a world-class expert in:
   <li>[[Physics]]</li>
  <li>[[First Aid]]</li>
  <li>Engineering</li>
  <li>[[Guitar Hero III]]</li>
After the user submitted the application, the site notifies the user that the user is not fit for space, or that the user's application is fine and "all you have to do is submit your video" a response to their video on YouTube. As a result, an open source Virgle group has been established, OpenVirgle. On the FAQ page, the final question is "Okay, come on – seriously. Is this Virgle thing for real?" The reply links to a page that tells the user it's an April Fool's joke, and then mentions that the user "Dragged us out of our lovely little fantasy world, to crush all our hopes and dreams."Google Virgle: 404 – Page Not Found

==== CADIE ====

The announcement of CADIE was made on March 31, 2009 11:59 pm by the CADIE Team, not on April 1. The announcement on the Google blog was made at 4/01/2009 12:01:00 am.
The introduction page and all of the references to CADIE in Google's Products were taken down on April 2, replaced with a message stating:
 We apologize for the recent disruption(s) to our service(s).

Please stand by while order is being restored.
However the technology page describing the technical capabilities of the software remained at:
When using Google Books or GMail, a user would come across an announcement dated March 31, 2009 at 11:59:59, declaring a new "Cognitive Autoheuristic Distributed-Intelligence Entity". CADIE is also mentioned on the gBall FAQ page: "Google's new CADIE technology will interpret the data obtained from each ball to provide useful tips to owners".  There was also a link on Google's Homepage for CADIE, and a blog entry in Google's official blog.
CADIE technology is also used to generate "senryu"  (a type of Japanese poem similar to haiku) based on search terms for certain Japanese queries.
The Google Search homepage had a link to the CADIE announcement, stating that "For several years now a small research group has been working on some challenging problems in the areas of neural networking, natural language and autonomous problem-solving. Last fall this group achieved a significant breakthrough: a powerful new technique for solving reinforcement learning problems, resulting in the first functional global-scale neuro-evolutionary learning cluster." The page links to the blog below.

==== YouTube ====

On April 1, 2009, YouTube gave some users a look at a new "viewing experience"[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] when they selected a video within certain areas such as the "recommended for you" section. This new interface caused the whole layout including the video you were watching to flip upside down. Although the option was not visible for some, it could be viewed by adding &flip=1 to the end of a video URL. Adding &flip=1 to the end of a video URL no longer causes this effect, and the video loads normally. A page on "tips for viewing the new layout" suggested users hang their monitors upside down from the ceiling, although the layout did not reverse mouse-control.

==== Gmail ====

When one is using the Gmail service, they will notice that it has a new option, named "Gmail Autopilot" in which the service would analyze an email. On that page it says under the FAQ section,"You can adjust tone, typo propensity, and preferred punctuation from the Autopilot tab under Settings." However, if a person logs into their Gmail account and goes under the Settings tab they will notice that there is no Autopilot tab. The program could be customised to contain certain types of grammatical or spelling errors, as well as complexity and length of the sentence. It also has a way of responding to relationship related messages, such as if someone spoke aggressively, even in a humorous way, the system would "terminate relationship."

Google claimed that the ball will cost $10 with a cost-per-kick set of payments in addition to the basic fee.

During the last minutes of Google's Data Center Efficiency Summit, Urs Hoelzle presented in a "special topic": Google had bought an oil tanker, the "M/S Sergey", where Google's data center containers were being submerged in oil tanks to enable extremely high-efficiency cooling. The presentation can be seen in the video, and includes slightly customized Wikipedia images from the
article Oil tanker, including a retouched photo of commercial oil tanker AbQaiq and the oil tankers side view graphic.
Even though Google did apply for a US patent to build data centers on cargo ships and oil cooling is an existing technology, summit attendee James Hamilton believed this topic to be an April Fools joke.[tpl]fact|date=June 2012[/tpl] The ship's name "M/S Sergey" is also likely to be a pun on Google's co-founder Sergey Brin.

==== Google and Topeka, Kansas, Switch Places [tpl]anchor|Google & Topeka, Kansas Switch Places[/tpl] ====

In early March, the city of Topeka, Kansas, temporarily changed its name to Google in an attempt to capture a spot in Google's new broadband/fiber-optics project.
