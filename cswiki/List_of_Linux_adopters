Linux adopters are organizations and individuals who have moved from other operating systems to Linux. Although Linux's status as a mainstream operating system is relatively recent, it is in use in many different environments, including government, education, home, business and scientific institutions.

==Government==

As local governments come under pressure from institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the International Intellectual Property Alliance, some have turned to Linux and other Free Software as an affordable, legal alternative to both pirated software and expensive proprietary  computer products from Microsoft, Apple and other commercial companies.
The spread of Linux affords some leverage for these countries when companies from the developed world bid for government contracts (since a low-cost option exists), while furnishing an alternative path to development for countries like India and Pakistan that have many citizens skilled in computer applications but cannot afford technological investment at "First World" prices.

==Education==

Linux is often used in technical disciplines at universities and research centres.  This is due to several factors, including that Linux is available free of charge and includes a large body of free/open source software.  To some extent, technical competence of computer science and software engineering academics is also a contributor, as is stability, maintainability, and upgradability.  IBM ran an advertising campaign entitled "Linux is Education" featuring a young boy who was supposed to be "Linux".YouTube - IBM Linux ad: Prodigy
