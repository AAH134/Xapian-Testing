Microsoft uses a variety of fictional companies in the documentation and training material for its products.  Microsoft documentation and learning materials often contain fictional scenarios and descriptions of how their products can be deployed and used in these scenarios.  Many of these companies are used in such examples.  Some of the fictional companies have associated websites, almost all of which redirect to Microsoft.com.
