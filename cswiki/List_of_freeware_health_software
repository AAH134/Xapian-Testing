EpiSurveyor is used for data collection in health, conservation, management, economics, and a variety of other fields. User organizations include the CDC, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the African Conservation Centre, TulaSalud, the US and Canadian governments, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, John Snow Inc, Abt Associates, and Management Sciences for Health, as well as many ministries of health. EpiSurveyor won the 2009 Wall Street Journal Award for Innovation in Healthcare (the first time an African-programmed software had won that distinction) and the 2009 Lemelson-MIT award for sustainable invention, as well as the Stockholm Challenge and Tech Museum Award. As reported on by Wired, the Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Voice of America, and BBC's Digital Planet.  Most recently, EpiSurveyor was covered extensively in an Economist white paper on healthcare innovation (p 13) and a World Bank study noting a 71% decrease in evaluation cost by using EpiSurveyor compared with paper.
