Locate32 is an open source file finder for Windows 98/ME/NT4/2000/XP/Vista/7. It works by indexing the files on the user's harddrives, thus making searches faster.http://www.techmalaya.com/2008/02/18/windows-file-search-locate32/ Removable or remote drives can also be indexed.http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/techscoop/11439/finding-things-just-got-easier. I was written by Janne Huttunen who indicated in September of 2011 that it will no longer be actively maintained. The latest and possibly last build is 3.1 RC3m 10.8220a.
