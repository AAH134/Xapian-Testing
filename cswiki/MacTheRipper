MacTheRipper is a Mac OS X application that enables users to create a playable copy of the contents of a Video DVD by defeating the Content Scramble System. During this process it may optionally modify or disable the DVD region code or the User operation prohibition features of the copied data. The previous lack of an OS X equivalent to the PC software DVDShrink gave this standalone DVD ripper widespread popularity among Macintosh users.macmod.com(macmod.com) Popular software listing
The current public release is version 2.6.6. MacTheRipper was developed in 2002 and since that time, it has had over two million users.
