==Acquiring Accoona==

On October 30, 2008, it was announced that Masterseek had acquired the B2B search engine Accoona.

The search engine had been fairly successful in the United States and China, where it had an exclusive partnership with China Daily News. On August 3, 2006, TIME had dubbed Accoona one of its "50 best websites," illustrating how the search engine used artificial intelligence to "understand" the meaning of keyword queries. Accoona had run into difficulties and gone defunct by early October 2008, withdrawing its IPO.
After Masterseek bought the remaining search engine codes, domain name, and assets, Accoona was integrated with Masterseek, and re-launched in the USA and China. It was launched in Europe in January 2009. Accoona information was also integrated into the Masterseek search engine.
