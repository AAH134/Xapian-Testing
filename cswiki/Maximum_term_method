The maximum-term method is a consequence of the large numbers encountered in statistical mechanics. It states that under appropriate conditions the logarithm of a summation is essentially equal to the logarithm of the maximum term in the summation.

==Example==

==Proof==

Consider the sum
Taking logarithm gives
Here we have
