Mean inter-particle distance (or mean inter-particle separation) is the mean distance between microscopic particles (usually atoms or molecules) in a macroscopic body.

==Ambiguity==

* "a potential energy ... is proportional to some power n of the inter-particle distance r" (Virial theorem)
* "the inter-particle distance is much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength" (Kinetic theory)

===Nearest neighbor distribution===

We want to calculate probability distribution function of distance to the nearest neighbor (NN) particle. (The problem was first considered by Paul Hertz; for a modern derivation see, e.g.,.[ref]{{Cite journal
