Microrheology is a technique to measure the rheological properties of a medium, such as microviscosity, via the measurement of the trajectory of a flow tracer (a micrometre-size particle). It is a new way of doing rheology, traditionally done using a rheometer. The size of the tracer is around a micrometre. There are two types of microrheology: passive microrheology and active microrheology. Passive microrheology uses inherent thermal energy to move the tracers, whereas active microrheology uses externally applied forces, such as from a magnetic field or an optical tweezer, to do so.  Microrheology can be further differentiated into 1- and 2-particle methods[ref]

== Passive microrheology==

 Passive microrheology  uses the thermal energy (kT) to move the tracers. The trajectories of the tracers are measured optically either by microscopy or by diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS). From the mean square displacement with respect to time (noted MSD or 2> ), one can calculate the visco-elastic moduli G′(ω) and G″(ω) using the generalized Stokes–Einstein relation (GSER). Here is a view of the trajectory of a particle of micrometer size.

Observing the MSD for a wide range of time scales gives information on the microstructure of the medium where are diffusing the tracers. If the tracers are having a free diffusion, on can deduce that the medium is purely viscous. If the tracers are having a sub-diffusive mean trajectory, it indicates that the medium presents some viscoelastic properties. For example, in a polymer network, the tracer may be trapped. The excursion δ of the tracer is related to the elastic modulus G′ with the relation G′ = kBT/(6πaδ2).
Microrheology is another way to do linear rheology. Since the force involved is very weak (order of 10−15 N), microrheology is guaranteed to be in the so-called linear region of the strain/stress relationship. It is also able to measure very small volumes (biological cell).

A related method of passive microrheology involves the tracking positions of a particle at a high frequency, often with a quadrant photodiode[ref]

==Active microrheology==

Active microrheology may use a magnetic field 
 or optical tweezers to apply a force on the tracer and then find the stress/strain relation.
