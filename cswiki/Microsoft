Microsoft Corporation ([tpl]NASDAQ|MSFT[/tpl]) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, United States that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services related to computing. It is the largest software corporation in the world measured by revenues. 
Microsoft was established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the home computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. The company's 1986 initial public offering, and the subsequent rise in the share price, created an estimated three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. In May 2011, Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5 billion in its largest acquisition to date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.searchofficespace.com/blog/sos-news/microsoft-buys-skype-for-8-5-billion.html |title=Microsoft buys Skype for $8.5 billion |publisher=The Search Office Space Blog |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate=April 4, 2011[/tpl]
As of 2012 Microsoft is market dominant in both the PC operating system and office suite markets (the latter with Microsoft Office). The company is also active in areas including internet search (with Bing), the video game industry (with the Xbox and Xbox 360 consoles), the digital services market (through MSN), and mobile phones (via the Windows Phone OS). 
In the 1990s, critics began to contend that Microsoft used monopolistic business practices and anti-competitive strategies including refusal to deal and tying, put unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software, and used misrepresentative marketing tactics; both the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission found the company in violation of antitrust laws. 

==History==

===Early history===

Paul Allen and Bill Gates, childhood friends with a passion in computer programming, were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills. The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer. Allen noticed that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device; after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration. Since they didn't actually have one, Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter. Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March 1975; MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC.[tpl]rp|108, 112–114[/tpl] They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm|title=Bill Gates: A Timeline|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=July 15, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2010[/tpl] Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft," as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article. In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office, "ASCII Microsoft".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n8/192_Kay_Nishi_bridges_the_cul.php|title=Kay Nishi bridges the cultural gap|author=Staples, Betsy|journal=Creative Computing|volume=10|issue=8|page=192|date=August 1984|accessdate=July 15, 2010[/tpl] The company moved to a new home in Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.
Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of Unix, called Xenix.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695|title=Under The Hood: Part 8|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060901182630/http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695|archivedate=September 11, 2006|work=Computer Source|author=Dyar, Dafydd Neal|date=November 4, 2002|accessdate=July 14, 2010[/tpl] However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC).[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k9xS6t4ibxoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Engines+that+move+markets:+technology+investing+from+railroads+to+the&hl=en&ei=BJThTfsoiK3yA4bgoJQH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=november%201980&f=false |title=Engines that move markets |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2011[/tpl] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, branding it as MS-DOS, which IBM rebranded to PC-DOS. Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since IBM copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS, other companies had to reverse engineer it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS's available software selection, Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Smart Computing|publisher=Sandhills Publishing Company|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/r0603/09r03/09r03.asp&guid=|title=Microsoft to Microsoft disk operating system (MS-DOS)|date=March 2002|accessdate=August 18, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite document|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JO6kA0hebJIC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=%22columbia+data+products%22+clone+bios&q=%22columbia%20data%20products%22%20clone%20bios|title=The Invisible Edge: Taking Your Strategy to the Next Level Using Intellectual Property|last=Blaxill|first=Mark|last2=Eckardt|first2=Ralph|publisher=Portfolio Hardcover|isbn=1-59184-237-9|date=March 5, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2010[/tpl][tpl]rp|210[/tpl] The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as a publishing division named Microsoft Press.[tpl]rp|232[/tpl] Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in February after developing Hodgkin's disease.[tpl]rp|231[/tpl]

On July 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part:
"Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive "per processor" licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f0000/0045.htm |title=Competitive Impact Statement : U.S. v.

==Product divisions==

For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows & Windows Live Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division.

===Windows & Windows Live Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division===

The company's Client division produces the flagship Windows OS line such as Windows 7; it also produces the Windows Live family of products and services. Server and Tools produces the server versions of Windows, such as Windows Server 2008 R2 as well as a set of development tools called Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Silverlight, a web application framework, and System Center Configuration Manager, a collection of tools providing remote-control abilities, patch management, software distribution and a hardware/software inventory. Other server products include: Microsoft SQL Server, a relational database management system, Microsoft Exchange Server, for certain business-oriented e-mail and scheduling features, Small Business Server, for messaging and other small business-oriented features; and Microsoft BizTalk Server, for business process management.
Microsoft provides IT consulting ("Microsoft Consulting Services") and produces a set of certification programs handled by the Server and Tools division designed to recognize individuals who have a minimal set of proficiencies in a specific role; this includes developers ("Microsoft Certified Solution Developer"), system/network analysts ("Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer"), trainers ("Microsoft Certified Trainers") and administrators ("Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator" and "Microsoft Certified Database Administrator"). Microsoft Press, which publishes books, is also managed by the division. The Online Services Business division handles the online service MSN and the search engine Bing. As of December 2009, the company also possesses an 18% ownership of the cable news channel MSNBC without any editorial control; however, the division develops the channel's website, msnbc.com, in a joint venture with the channel's co-owner, NBC Universal.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/24/business/media/24msnbc.html|title=Microsoft Quits MSNBC TV, but Web Partnership Remains|work=The New York Times|author=Carter, Bill|date=December 24, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2010[/tpl]

===Business Division===

The Microsoft Business Division produces Microsoft Office including Microsoft Office 2010, the company's line of office software. The software product includes Word (a word processor), Access (a relational database program), Excel (a spreadsheet program), Outlook (Groupware, frequently used with Exchange Server), PowerPoint (presentation software), Publisher (desktop publishing software) and Sharepoint. A number of other products were added later with the release of Office 2003 including Visio, Project, MapPoint, InfoPath and OneNote.

==Criticism==

Criticism of Microsoft has followed the company's existence because of various aspects of its products and business practices. Ease of use, stability, and security of the company's software are common targets for critics. More recently, Trojan horses and other exploits have plagued numerous users due to faults in the security of Microsoft Windows and other programs. Microsoft is also accused of locking vendors into their products, and of not following and complying with existing standards in its software.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/writing_history_with_microsofts_office/|title=Writing history with Microsoft's Office lock-in[/tpl] Total cost of ownership comparisons of Linux as well as Mac OS X to Windows are a continuous point of debate.
The company has been in numerous lawsuits by several governments and other companies for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the European Union found Microsoft guilty in a highly publicized anti-trust case. Additionally, Microsoft's EULA for some of its programs is often criticized as being too restrictive as well as being against open source software. 
Microsoft has been criticized (along with Yahoo, AOL, and other companies) for its involvement in censorship in the People's Republic of China.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/ | title=Corporate Complicity in Chinese Internet Censorship | accessdate=2006-11-23[/tpl] Microsoft has also come under criticism for outsourcing jobs to China and India."Who's buying Microsoft's outsourcing excuses?".
