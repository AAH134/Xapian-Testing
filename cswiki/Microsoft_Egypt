The CMIC mission  is to foster an environment of innovation in the Arab region that leverages local talent and collaborative research to incubate and develop strategic technologies that enable novel local experiences and pave the way for Microsoft opportunities. The success measure is the impact of research and incubations both on Microsoft's products and on the people in the Arab region. CMIC strive to provide the people in Arab region with technologies that enable them to fully utilize the computers and the Internet to fulfill their personal and business needs. To accomplish these objectives, CMIC have zoomed in on three key R&D areas that have the highest potential of impacting the region: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Digital Content Services (DCS), and Mobile Multimedia. These areas have also been picked due to the high potential of transferring our R & D in these areas into real Microsoft products.
CMIC team is leading the effort to enable Microsoft's Decision Engine, Bing (www.bing.com) in the Arab Region. Our efforts include solving issues that are specific to Arabic search and monitoring and enhancing the quality of the Arabic index.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/middleeast/Egypt/CMIC/Issue4/cmicmovingforward.aspx|title= Microsoft Innovation Laboratory in Cairo [/tpl]
