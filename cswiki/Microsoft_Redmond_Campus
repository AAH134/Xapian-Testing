Microsoft Redmond Campus is the informal name for Microsoft's corporate headquarters, located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. 
It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft2 (750,000 m2) of office space and 30,000-40,000 employees.http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/inside_ms.mspx Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah (90,000 employees world-wide). Further signs of growth include:
