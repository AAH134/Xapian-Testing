The Microsoft hoax was an Internet hoax suggesting that the information technology company Microsoft had acquired the Catholic Church. It is considered to be the first Internet hoax to reach a mass audience.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/msft.html|first= Alex|last=Boese |title=Microsoft Buys the Catholic Church |work=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=2010-11-05 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Email Hoaxes: Form, Function, Genre Ecology |last=Heyd |first=Theresa |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=90-272-5418-4 |page=4 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jUTkPqhvd-wC |accessdate=October 30, 2010[/tpl]

== The press release ==

The hoax consisted of a press release, purportedly from the Associated Press, that circulated around the Internet in 1994. The press release claimed that Microsoft "will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of Microsoft common stock," and that the company expects "a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years... the combined resources of Microsoft and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people."[tpl]cite web |url=http://ifaq.wap.org/computers/microsoftcatholic.html |title=Microsoft acquires the Catholic Church |work=Washington Apple Pi |accessdate=2010-11-05 [/tpl]
Many of the press release's claims were unrealistic, from suggesting that Catholics would soon be able to take Holy Communion through their computer to claiming that conversion to Catholicism was an "upgrade". Despite these warning signs, several readers of the false press release contacted Microsoft to confirm the claims of the hoax, and on December 16, 1994, Microsoft formally debunked the claims.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7457191.stm |work=BBC NEWS |title= Timeline: Bill Gates and Microsoft |publisher=BBC|accessdate=2010-11-05 |date=2008-06-18[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

Follow-up press releases made similarly outrageous claims - for example, one false press release claimed that IBM had acquired the Episcopal Church, and another suggested that the Italian television network RAI had invested in what the release claimed to be "Microsoft Corp.'s planned on-line computer service, the Microsoft Divine Network."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.2meta.com/april-fools/1994/Microsoft-buys-Vatican.html |title=1994 Fools: Microsoft to Buy Catholic Church|work= April Fools on the Net |publisher=www.2meta.com |accessdate=2010-11-05 [/tpl]
Despite the proliferation of chain emails circulating the Internet both in 1994 and in the present, the Microsoft hoax was considered the first such hoax to reach a mass audience through the Internet.
