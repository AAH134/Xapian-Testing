Minibloq is a graphical development environment for Arduino and other platforms. Its main objective is to help in teaching programming. It is specially used in robotics at high school.

== How it works ==

Minibloq is a code generator. Every code block is configured in XML. In its first version, permits to see the generating code (for this purpose uses Scintilla). Here are some examples of code generated for Arduino:

== Platforms ==

Although this software was developed for Windows, it is not limited to it.
