Monmouthpedia (stylised as [tpl]Smallcaps|MonmouthpediA[/tpl]) is a collaborative project linking the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia and the town of Monmouth in South Wales.[tpl]cite news|title=Wikipedia project to cover life in Monmouth|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-16359364|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=BBC Online|date=30 December 2011[/tpl]  
The project uses QRpedia QR codes to provide multilingual smart phone access to Wikipedia articles covering notable subjects in Monmouth, such as places, people, artefacts, flora and fauna.[tpl]cite web|title=MonmouthpediA – The World's First Wikipedia Town|url=http://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/info/100002/business/1429/monmouthpedia|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl]  It was formally launched on 19 May 2012, and led to Monmouth being described as the "world's first Wikipedia town".[tpl]cite news|title=Monmouth to be Wales' first WiFi town|url=http://www.monmouth-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=7508|publisher=Monmouth Today|date=29 February 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Welsh town of Monmouth gets Wikipedia treatment|url=http://www.computeractive.co.uk/ca/news/2141730/welsh-town-monmouth-wikipedia-treatment|publisher=Computer Active|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Monmouth to be first Wiki-town|url=http://www.cinderford-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=1766&headline=Monmouth%20to%20be%20first%20Wiki-town|publisher=Forest of Dean and Wye Valley Review|date=18 January 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl]

== Inception ==

The idea of Monmouthpedia was conceived in late 2011 by John Cummings, a resident of Monmouth. Cummings attended a TEDx event in Bristol which discussed the QRpedia project in use at Derby Museum and Art Gallery.[tpl]cite web|title=Monmouth becomes the world’s first Wikipedia town|url=http://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/news/article/587/monmouth_becomes_the_worlds_first_wikipedia_town|publisher=Monmouthshire County Council|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl] Cummings founded the project with chair of Wikimedia UK, Roger Bamkin, who co-founded QRpedia.  The project was subsequently supported by Monmouthshire County Council, and the council-owned Shire Hall later announced plans to instate a Wikipedian-in-Residence and introduce sessions to help visitors with contributions to the project.
Monmouthpedia's initial goal was to have 1,000 Wikipedia articles linked by April 2012, with each article having a corresponding ceramic plaque emblazoned with a QR code.[tpl]cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Wikipedia puts Monmouth on frontier of a new kind of local history|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/26/wikipedia-monmouth-residents-local-website|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 January 2012[/tpl] By May, the project's home page reported 712 new and improved articles in 25 different languages.  For non-English speakers, where available, articles in other languages are automatically displayed in the language of the user on the basis of the phone's language configuration. At project launch, some 500 articles in other languages were available thanks to the collaboration of editors abroard."Monmouthpedia : la ville Wikipédia", GNT, 18 May 2012.

In the same period, over 1,000 photographs were uploaded.[tpl]cite web|title=Monmouthpedia Achievements|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/MonmouthpediA/Achievements|work=Monmouthpedia|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=6 May 2012[/tpl]
Monmouth Library has become the first library in the world to add QR codes to books. Users with smart phones can now instantly find Wikipedia articles on the book and its author. Priority has been given to local literature and Welsh titles but recent acquisitions on the Queen's Jubilee and the Olympics have also been QR coded."Monmouth Library First in the World", Monmouthshire Libraries, 21 May 2012.

== Reception ==

Glyn Moody, writing for Techdirt, questioned whether Monmouthpedia was the future of Wikipedia.[tpl]cite news|last=Moody|first=Glyn|title=Is Monmouthpedia The Future Of Wikipedia?|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120102/08191517252/is-monmouthpedia-future-wikipedia.shtml|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=Techdirt|date=5 January 2012[/tpl]   He described the project as creating "a kind of fractal Wikipedia" likening it to the 2010 film Inception, potentially enabling "a Wikipedia within a Wikipedia within a Wikipedia." Within days of the launch, the initiative had led to widespread interest. Stevie Benton from Wikimedia UK reported that the project page had been viewed 10,000 times. Benton also reported there had been inquiries from towns in Norway, Britain, France, Scotland and Texas, USA. One test of success will however be the project's ability to attract more tourists to the town.Erika Morphy, "Tiny Welsh Burg Paints the Town Wiki", TechNewsWorld, 21 May 2012. Retrieved 22 May 2012.
Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, was enthusiastic about the initiative. "I’m really excited by the Monmouthpedia project," he said. "Bringing a whole town to life on Wikipedia is something new and is a testament to the forward-thinking people of Monmouth, all of the volunteers and the Wikimedia UK team. I’m looking forward to seeing other towns and cities doing the same thing."Timon Singh, "Monmouth: The World’s First Wikipedia Town Launches In Wales", Inhabitat, 22 May 2012. Retrieved 23 May 2012.
