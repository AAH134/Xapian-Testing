Mooers' Law is an empirical observation of behavior made by American computer scientist Calvin Mooers in 1959. The observation is made in relation to information retrieval and the interpretation of the observation is used commonly throughout the information profession both within and outside its original context.

==Original interpretation==

Mooers argued that information is at risk of languishing unused due not only on the effort required to assimilate it but also to any fallout that could arise from the discovery of information that conflicts with the users personal, academic or corporate interests. In interacting with new information, a user runs the risk of proving their work incorrect or even irrelevant. Instead, Mooers argued, users prefer to remain in a state of safety in which new arguments are ignored in an attempt to save potential embarrassment or reprisal from supervisors.[tpl]cite web|last=Mooers|first=Calvin|title=Mooers Law, or Why some Retrieval Systems are Used and Others Are not|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3633/is_199610/ai_n8749122/|work=Business Library|accessdate=25 October 2011[/tpl]

==Out-of-context interpretation==

The more commonly used interpretation of Mooers' Law is considered to be a derivation of the principle of least effort first stated by George Kingsley Zipf. This interpretation focuses on the amount of effort that will be expended to use and understand a particular information retrieval system before the information seeker 'gives up', and the Law is often paraphrased to increase the focus on the retrieval system:
In this interpretation, "painful and troublesome" comes from using the retrieval system.
