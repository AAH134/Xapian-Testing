msnbot was a web-crawling robot (type of internet bot), deployed by Microsoft to collect documents from the web to build a searchable index for the MSN Search engine. It went into beta in 2004, and had full public release in 2005. The month of October 2010 saw the official retirement of msnbot and its replacement by bingbot.Steve Tullis, Bingbot, the Sequel Webmaster Center blog, Bing Community, September 29 2010
