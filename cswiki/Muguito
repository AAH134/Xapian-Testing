Muguito was a freeware Java application used by the Artists Against 419 to take some fraudulent websites offline. It was a replacement for the Mugu Marauder tool.
The program worked by repeatedly downloading the scam site's images and HTML files until the site's bandwidth limit was exceeded. Many people used this program at the same time, and a site could be quickly taken offline.
Some people confused what the artists did with a denial-of-service attack. A DoS attack affects all websites on the server or network. However, Muguito did not do this. Muguito was programmed to stop downloading if the server did not respond after a certain amount of time. Its aim was to have the site shut down by the server when the site's small bandwidth limit was exceeded.
Another, similar tool used by AA419 was the Lad Vampire. Both Muguito and the Lad Vampire were very easy and straightforward to use.
Note: AA419 stopped using the Lad Vampire and Muguito in September 2007. Neither is operational now.
