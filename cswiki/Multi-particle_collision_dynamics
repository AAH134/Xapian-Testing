==Method of simulation==

During the streaming step, the coordinates of the particles are updated according to
If the structure of the collision grid defined by the positions of the collision cells is fixed, Galilean invariance is violated. It is restored with the introduction of a random shift of the collision grid.T. Ihle and D. Kroll "Stochastic rotation dynamics. I. Formalism, Galilean invariance, and Green-Kubo relations", Physical Review E 67 066705 (2003)
Explicit expressions for the diffusion coefficient and viscosity derived based on Green-Kubo relations are in excellent agreement with simulations.T. Ihle, E. Tüzel and D. M.

==Simulation parameters==

The set of parameters for the simulation of the solvent are:
* kT (energy)
The simulation parameters define the solvent properties, such as
