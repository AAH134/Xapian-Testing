==Subprojects==

As of October 2010, MyDLP include the following subprojects[tpl]cite web | url=http://github.com/mydlp | title=GitHub Profile of MyDLP| publisher=MyDLP Development Team | accessdate=2010-10-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.slideshare.net/barfan/mydlp-v10-tantm | title=MyDLP Brochure| publisher=MyDLP Development Team | accessdate=2010-10-27[/tpl]:
* MyDLP Network: Network server of the project, which is used for high load network operations such as intercepting TCP connections and hosting MyDLP network services.
* MyDLP Endpoint: Remote agent of the project, which runs on endpoint machines in order to inspect end user operations such as copying a file to an external device, printing a document and capturing screenshots.
* MyDLP Web UI: Management interface for system administrators to configure MyDLP. It pushes relevant parts of system configuration to both MyDLP Network and MyDLP Endpoint.

==Platforms and interfaces==

MyDLP Network is mostly written in Erlang, because of its performance on concurrent network operations [tpl]cite web | url=http://downloads.medratech.com/help/help.html | title=MyDLP Feature and Help Documentation | publisher=MyDLP Development Team| accessdate=2010-10-26[/tpl].
