NNPDF is used to denote the  parton distribution functions from the NNPDF Collaboration which is based on a
combination of a Monte Carlo method for experimental data sampling with the use of neural networks as basic interpolating functions.

== The NNPDF approach ==

The NNPDF approach can be divided into four main steps:
* The generation of a large sample of Monte Carlo replicas of the original experimental data, in a way that central values, errors and correlations are reproduced with enough accuracy.
* The neural network training is stopped dynamically before entering into the overlearning regime, that is, so that the PDFs learn the physical laws which underlie experimental data without fitting simultaneously statistical noise.
* Once the training of the MC replicas has been completed, a set of statistical estimators can be applied to the set of PDFs, in order to assess the statistical consistency of our results. For example, the stability with respect PDF parametrization can be explicitly verified.
