A nanomagnet is a submicrometric system that presents spontaneous magnetic order (magnetization) at zero applied magnetic field (remanence). 
The small size of nanomagnets prevents the formation of magnetic domains (see single domain (magnetic)). The magnetization dynamics of sufficiently small nanomagnets at low temperatures, typically single-molecule magnets, presents quantum phenomena, such as macroscopic spin tunnelling. At larger temperatures, the magnetization undergoes random thermal fluctuations (superparamagnetism) which present a limit for the use of nanomagnets for permanent information storage. 
Canonical examples of nanomagnets are grains [ref]S. Guéron et al., Tunneling vis Individual Electronic States in Ferromagnetic Nanoparticles, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 4148 (1999)

 Oxford University Press, 2006 ISBN 0-19-856753-7</ref>. The vast majority of nanomagnets feature transition metal ([[titanium]], [[vanadium]], [[chromium]], [[manganese]], iron, cobalt or nickel) or rare earth (Gd, Eu, Er) magnetic atoms.
Attending to the number of magnetic atoms, the smallest nanomagnets reported so far are double decker phthalocyanes with only one rare earth atom.[ref] N. Ishikawa, M. Sugita, W. Wernsdorfer J. Am. Chem. Soc. 127, 3650 (2005)
[/ref] Canonical single-molecule magnets are the so called Mn12  and Fe8 systems, with 12 and 8 transition metal atoms each and both with spin 10 (S=10) ground states. 
The phenomenon of zero field magnetization requires three conditions: 
* (1) A ground state with finite spin
* (2) a magnetic anisotropy energy barrier
* (3) long spin relaxation time. 
Conditions (1) and (2), but not (3), have been demonstrated in a number of nanostructures, such as nanoparticles,P. Gambardella et al., Giant magnetic anisotropy of single Co atoms and nanoparticles,  Science 300, 1130 (2003), nanoislands, C. F. Hirjibehedin, C. P. Lutz, and A. J. Heinrich, Spin Coupling in Engineered Atomic Structures.  Science 312, 1021  (2006) and quantum dots[ref]Y. Leger et al., Electrical Control of a Single Mn atom in a Quantum Dot

A nanomagnet can have enhanced electronic properties due to size effect, such as long spin relaxation time of conduction electron, which may be useful for nano-scale spintronic device P. N. Hai, S. Ohya, and M. Tanaka,Long spin-relaxation time in a single metal nanoparticle, Nature Nanotechnology 5, 593–596 (2010).
