==Comparison with other phones==

Though the multi-touch experience of the Nexus One is generally similar to that of other multi-touch enabled smartphones (iPhone, Palm Pre, etc), the Nexus One hardware uses software to "enable" multi-touch ability, resulting in x/y axis confusion and preventing some multi-touch applications (e.g. games) from working as they should, compared to other phones.YouTube - Motorola Droid vs Nexus One: Multitouch Test As of an update released February 2, 2010 it has pinch-to-zoom  functionality in the phone's  Browser, Gallery and Maps applications. In addition to these official  applications, 3rd party apps that support multi-touch gestures  are available.

===HTC Desire===

HTC later released the HTC Desire, which has very similar specifications to the Nexus One. The Desire features an optical trackpad rather than a trackball, physical buttons rather than the touch sensitive buttons and an FM radio but lacks the noise cancelling dual microphones present in the Nexus One. The Desire is solely branded as HTC and runs HTC Sense rather than the stock version of Android. Sense can be switched off to get the stock Android experience however this was disabled on the retail HTC Desire.AndroidCentral

==Reception==

* The Android 2.2 update caused the Nexus One to develop a serious Wi-Fi connectivity issue which causes the Wi-Fi to continually lose its connection and fail to reconnect. There are reports that Android 2.2.1 has fixed this issue, although there has been no official word from Google.
* The Nexus One reportedly had problems with 3G connectivity and touchscreen at launch. Updates have since been issued for the operating system, including the addition of multi-touch abilities in the Android web browser and Google Maps functions. While the updates have reportedly also somewhat improved 3G connectivity for the T-Mobile USA version of the device, similar issues with the AT&T compatible version have not yet been addressed. A class action lawsuit is pending against Google on the matter, as the phone has problems connecting to 3G networks in areas with less than ideal coverage.
* Initially, Google did not provide telephone support and consumers were forced to use its online Android forum. At this time, Google has stopped all support for the phone and customers are directed to contact HTC.
* The Nexus One is currently shipped to the US, the UK, Hong Kong, Germany and Singapore, although the phone has not been fully localized for non-US markets - the lack of satnav outside the US,Why is Google Nav is only available in USA - Google Mobile Help UK and Ireland,Google launches free sat nav for Irish Android users - News - News | siliconrepublic.com - Ireland's Technology News Service and the US English "voice keyboard"UK voice input - Android Help being the most obvious shortcomings.

* Goldman Sachs slashed their estimates for sales of the phone in 2010 by 70% due to the half-hearted marketing efforts by carriers.

==Support==

On July 16, 2010, Google announced that the next shipment of Nexus One smartphones would be the last to be sold on their web store, stating "While the global adoption of the Android platform has exceeded our expectations, the web store has not. It’s remained a niche channel for early adopters, but it’s clear that many customers like a hands-on experience before buying a phone."
As of November 1, 2010 Google have closed the Nexus One support forums, redirecting users to the Google Mobile forum, which only has categories for software. The message shown to users was: "The Nexus One forum will be archived and become read-only on November 1st. Please see the Nexus One Terms of Sale for details regarding support. If you have questions about using applications on your Nexus One post them to the Google Mobile Forum." Also worthy of note is that the link to Terms of Sale on that message has no mention of support, contrary to what the message implies.
As of the announcement of Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, HTC has announced that there will be no more software updates for the Nexus One, as the hardware is now too old to run the new version of Android effectively.

==Nexus S==

According to Andy Rubin, the next Nexus series phone would have targeted business users and may have had a hardware keyboard.
However, on November 11, 2010, Engadget leaked some pictures of a Samsung manufactured Nexus S device along with marketing materials from Best Buy and T-Mobile USA in the United States.
Google officially announced the Nexus S on December 6, 2010. The device, built by Samsung, was the first to ship with Android OS version 2.3 "Gingerbread" and includes Near Field Communication (NFC) hardware.
