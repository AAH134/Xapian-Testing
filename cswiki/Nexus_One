==Hardware==

At time of launch, the Nexus One had a 3.7 inch AMOLED screen with PenTile matrix pixel arrangement.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/03/iphones-lcd-screen-beats-nexus-ones-oled-display|accessdate=March 3, 2010|title=iPhone's LCD Screen Beats Nexus One's OLED Display|publisher=Wired|first=Priya|last=Ganapati|date=March 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stealthcopter.com/blog/2010/06/nexus-ones-amoled-screen-under-the-microscope|accessdate=June 11, 2010|title=Nexus One's AMOLED screen under the microscope|publisher=stealthcopter.com[/tpl] The raster resolution is 480×800 pixels, however each pixel in the PenTile RGBG display is represented by only two subpixels on average, using subpixel rendering rather than the three found in most displays, meeting the definition of WVGA according to the Video Electronics Standards Association specifications for measuring resolution.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/files/pdf/measuring-pentile-display-resolution-vesa-standards.pdf|accessdate=March 4, 2011|title=Application Note Measuring Display Resolution with Contrast Modulation Methodology|publisher=Nouvoyance[/tpl]
Citing supply shortages of AMOLED displays, HTC announced on July 26, 2010 that the Nexus One would begin using Super LCD display technology instead of AMOLED. The Super LCD display was described as having greater power efficiency and color accuracy than the AMOLED display, while sacrificing the lauded color saturation and deep blacks of the original display. As of January 15, 2011 or earlier, all Nexus Ones available via Brightstar, Google's worldwide distribution partner for Android development phones, shipped with Super LCD instead of AMOLED.

==Comparison with other phones==

Though the multi-touch experience of the Nexus One is generally similar to that of other multi-touch enabled smartphones (iPhone, Palm Pre, etc), the Nexus One hardware uses software to "enable" multi-touch ability, resulting in x/y axis confusion and preventing some multi-touch applications (e.g. games) from working as they should, compared to other phones.YouTube - Motorola Droid vs Nexus One: Multitouch Test As of an update released February 2, 2010[tpl]cite web|title=Nexus One Update Announcement|publisher= googlenexusoneboard.blogspot.com|url=http://googlenexusoneboard.blogspot.com/2010/02/new-software-update-for-nexus-one.html|date=2010-02-02|accessdate=2010-02-04[/tpl] it has pinch-to-zoom  functionality in the phone's  Browser, Gallery and Maps applications. In addition to these official  applications, 3rd party apps that support multi-touch gestures  are available.

===HTC Desire===

HTC later released the HTC Desire, which has very similar specifications to the Nexus One. The Desire features an optical trackpad rather than a trackball, physical buttons rather than the touch sensitive buttons and an FM radio but lacks the noise cancelling dual microphones present in the Nexus One. The Desire is solely branded as HTC and runs HTC Sense rather than the stock version of Android. Sense can be switched off to get the stock Android experience however this was disabled on the retail HTC Desire.AndroidCentral

==Reception==

* The Android 2.2 update caused the Nexus One to develop a serious Wi-Fi connectivity issue which causes the Wi-Fi to continually lose its connection and fail to reconnect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/android/thread?tid=461352ddadac96d2&hl=en |title=Whats wrong with the Nexus ONe's WiFi ?!?!!!!![/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/android/thread?tid=75896215b18c3d6d&hl=en |title=Nexus 1 WiFi connectivity problems: hot spots signal too low even I am near those devices.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/android/thread?tid=3d253758857e6f67&hl=en |title=Nexus One will not connect to wifi network[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/android/thread?tid=670e46135cadce1e&hl=en  |title=Nexus one cant connect to wifi[/tpl] There are reports that Android 2.2.1 has fixed this issue, although there has been no official word from Google.

While the updates have reportedly also somewhat improved 3G connectivity for the T-Mobile USA version of the device, similar issues with the AT&T compatible version have not yet been addressed. A class action lawsuit is pending against Google on the matter, as the phone has problems connecting to 3G networks in areas with less than ideal coverage.
* Initially, Google did not provide telephone support and consumers were forced to use its online Android forum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/186643/support_problems_good_reason_to_avoid_nexus_one.html |title=Support Problems Good Reason to Avoid Nexus One |publisher=PC World |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2010-02-07|quote=Since its introduction last week, support forums have been busily documenting customer problems, mostly 3G service issues, which T-Mobile USA has acknowledged.

==Support==

On July 16, 2010, Google announced that the next shipment of Nexus One smartphones would be the last to be sold on their web store, stating "While the global adoption of the Android platform has exceeded our expectations, the web store has not. It’s remained a niche channel for early adopters, but it’s clear that many customers like a hands-on experience before buying a phone."[tpl]cite news|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/nexus-one-changes-in-availability.html |title=Nexus One changes in availability[/tpl]  The device will continue to be sold through retail stores, and other channel partners.Android Developers Blog: Nexus One Developer Phone[tpl]cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/07/19/nexus.one.discontinued/index.html?iref=NS1#fbid=nPeDbHV_wpr |title=Google quietly kills its once-hyped Nexus One phone |first=Doug |last=Gross |publisher=CNN |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010[/tpl]
As of November 1, 2010 Google have closed the Nexus One support forums, redirecting users to the Google Mobile forum, which only has categories for software. The message shown to users was: "The Nexus One forum will be archived and become read-only on November 1st. Please see the Nexus One Terms of Sale for details regarding support. If you have questions about using applications on your Nexus One post them to the Google Mobile Forum."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/android?hl=en |title=Android Help |date=October 25, 2010[/tpl] Also worthy of note is that the link to Terms of Sale on that message has no mention of support, contrary to what the message implies.
As of the announcement of Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, HTC has announced that there will be no more software updates for the Nexus One, as the hardware is now too old to run the new version of Android effectively.[tpl]cite news|last=Warman|first=Matt|title=Android upgrade for Google Nexus S ‘in weeks’|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8848669/Android-upgrade-for-Google-Nexus-S-in-weeks.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 November 2011|location=London|date=October 26, 2011[/tpl]

However, on November 11, 2010, Engadget leaked some pictures of a Samsung manufactured Nexus S device along with marketing materials from Best Buy and T-Mobile USA in the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/11/this-is-the-nexus-s/ |title=This is the Nexus S |publisher=Engadget |date= November 11, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-11[/tpl]
