The Nexus S is a smartphone co-developed by Google and Samsung and manufactured by Samsung Electronics. It was the first smartphone to use the Android 2.3 "Gingerbread" operating system, and the first Android device to support Near Field Communication (NFC) in both hardware and software. This was the third time that Google worked with a manufacturer to produce a phone, the first and second being the Google G1 and the Nexus One, both by HTC. Its successor, the Galaxy Nexus, also by Samsung, was released in November 2011.
The Nexus S is produced with four variations. The GT-I9020 (Super AMOLED) and GT-I9023 (Super Clear LCD), each aimed at different markets. The SPH-D720 is the newer 4G version of the phone available in the US. A variant of the GT-I9020, SHW-M200, was released specifically for the Korean market.

== History and availability ==

The Nexus S was demonstrated by Google CEO Eric Schmidt on November 15, 2010 at the Web 2.0 Summit. Google officially announced the phone on their blog on December 6, 2010.  The phone became available for purchase on December 16 in the US and on December 22 in the UK.
The Super AMOLED version of the phone is the GT-I9020 and it is based on the Samsung Galaxy S hardware, the principal hardware differences being the absence of support for an SD card and the addition of a near field chip. The alternate SC-LCD (Super Clear LCD) version of the phone is the GT-I9023 which is meant for the European (non-UK) market.
In May 2011 Sprint introduced its Nexus S in the US. Unlike the GSM version, the Sprint Nexus runs on its WiMax network and uses CDMA instead of GSM.
Also in March 2011 Vodafone released a white version of the phone on its web store in the UK.

The review by The Register gave the Nexus S an 85% rating and summarized it as a "cool, innovative device with an eye to snatch Apple’s smartphone crown."
An AnandTech review praised the display, NFC tag reader, and Android Gingerbread operating system, but noted the lack of 720p video recording, HSPA+ baseband, and external storage support.

A TechRadar review praised the Nexus S for fixing the GPS problems experienced with the Samsung Galaxy S: "The good news for those looking to upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S – the GPS issues have been resolved, in that you can actually now get a signal with no problem."
CNET's review was enthusiastic about the display, operating system, and performance. CNET noted the lack of 720p video recording, HDMI output and external (SD Card) memory support.
