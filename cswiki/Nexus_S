The Nexus S is a smartphone co-developed by Google and Samsung and manufactured by Samsung Electronics. It was the first smartphone to use the Android 2.3 "Gingerbread" operating system, and the first Android device to support Near Field Communication (NFC) in both hardware and software.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/15/the-nexus-s-a-closer-look/|title=The Nexus S: a closer look|last=Hollister|first=Sean|date=November 15, 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=16 November 2010[/tpl] This was the third time that Google worked with a manufacturer to produce a phone, the first and second being the Google G1 and the Nexus One, both by HTC. Its successor, the Galaxy Nexus, also by Samsung, was released in November 2011.
The Nexus S is produced with four variations. The GT-I9020 (Super AMOLED) and GT-I9023 (Super Clear LCD), each aimed at different markets. The SPH-D720 is the newer 4G version of the phone available in the US. A variant of the GT-I9020, SHW-M200, was released specifically for the Korean market.

== History and availability ==

The Nexus S was demonstrated by Google CEO Eric Schmidt on November 15, 2010 at the Web 2.0 Summit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/15/eric-schmidt-shows-off-a-nexus-s-at-the-web-2-0-summit/|title=Eric Schmidt shows off a Nexus S at the Web 2.0 summit, says Gingerbread coming in 'next few weeks'|last=Patel|first=Nilay|date=November 15, 2010|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=16 November 2010[/tpl] Google officially announced the phone on their blog on December 6, 2010.  The phone became available for purchase on December 16 in the US and on December 22 in the UK.
The Super AMOLED version of the phone is the GT-I9020 and it is based on the Samsung Galaxy S hardware, the principal hardware differences being the absence of support for an SD card and the addition of a near field chip. The alternate SC-LCD (Super Clear LCD) version of the phone is the GT-I9023 which is meant for the European (non-UK) market.
In May 2011 Sprint introduced its Nexus S in the US. Unlike the GSM version, the Sprint Nexus runs on its WiMax network and uses CDMA instead of GSM.
Also in March 2011 Vodafone released a white version of the phone on its web store in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://shop.vodafone.co.uk/shop/mobile-phone/samsung-nexus-s?replaceSkuId=sku4250032|title= Google Nexus S White - Vodafone UK|accessdate=March 6, 2011[/tpl]

In France, it is available through SFR and Bouygues Telecom
In India, Samsung has officially announced sale of the unlocked version with Super LCD screen i9023, which will support all GSM-based carriers throughout the country,
