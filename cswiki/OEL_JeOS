In computing, Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS (OEL JeOS), an opensource  JeOS project, aims at making it easy to create  software appliances. OEL JeOS includes a pre-packaged, small-footprint Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) image (either OEL 4.7 or OEL 5.2) for x86 and x86-64, along with a script to customize the image. This results in a freely re-distributable  OS-image designed to work with Oracle VM virtualization.

== Technical highlights ==

* Easy-to-use configuration scripts allow automation and script-template creation
* Small footprint (around 250 MB) - permits starting small and adding just the packages (rpms) needed for end-user software to run
* Packaged as an Oracle VM template, importable using Oracle VM Manager
* Based on Oracle Enterprise Linux

== Released templates ==

* Oracle Application Server 10g Release 3 Webcenter
* Oracle Database Templates
* Oracle Enterprise Linux Templates
* Oracle Enterprise Manager Templates
* Oracle Fusion Middleware Service Oriented Architecture on WebLogic Server 9.2
* Oracle Siebel CRM Templates
