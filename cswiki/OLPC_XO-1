==History==

The first early prototype was unveiled by the project's founder Nicholas Negroponte and then-United Nations Secretary-General  Kofi Annan on November 16, 2005, at the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis, Tunisia.UN debut for $100 laptop for poor. BBC, 17 November 2005. The device shown was a rough prototype using a standard development board. Negroponte estimated that the screen alone required three more months of development.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] The first working prototype was demonstrated at the project's Country Task Force Meeting on May 23, 2006.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
In 2006 there was a major controversy because Microsoft had suddenly developed an interest in the XO project and wanted the formerly open source effort to run Windows. Negroponte agreed to provide engineer assistance to Microsoft to facilitate their efforts. During this time, the project mission statement changed to remove mentions of "open source". A number of developers, such as Ivan Krstić and Walter Bender, resigned because of these changes in strategy.http://www.olpcnews.com/software/operating_system/microsoft_windows_olpc.html[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7405346.stm | work=BBC News | title='$100 Laptop' Platform Moves On | date=May 16, 2008 | first=Jonathan | last=Fildes[/tpl]http://www.zdnet.com/blog/government/xp-on-xo-negroponte-has-lost-his-bearings/3824 [tpl]as of|2011[/tpl], no laptops have been shipped by OLPC with Windows installed.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

==Design==

The XO-1 is designed to be low-cost, small, durable, and efficient. It is shipped with a slimmed-down version of Fedora Linux and a GUI named Sugar that is intended to help young children collaborate. The XO-1 includes a video camera, a microphone, long-range Wi-Fi, and a hybrid stylus/touch pad. In addition to a standard plug-in power supply, human power and solar power sources are available, allowing operation far from a commercial power grid. Mary Lou Jepsen has listed the design goals of the device as follows:"A conversation with Mary Lou Jepsen", ACM Queue journal, November 1, 2007
*minimal power consumption, with a design target of 2–3 W total power consumption
*minimal production cost, with a target of US$100 per laptop for production runs of millions of units
*a "cool" look, implying innovative styling in its physical appearance
*e-book functionality with extremely low power consumption
*open source and free software provided with the laptop
Various use models had been explored by OLPC with the help of Design Continuum and Fuseproject, including: laptop, e-book, theatre, simulation, tote, and tablet architectures. The current design, by Fuseproject, uses a transformer hinge to morph between laptop, e-book, and router modes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]

====Intentionally omitted features====

In keeping with its goals of robustness and low power consumption, the design of the laptop intentionally omits all motor-driven moving parts; it has no hard drive, no optical (CD/DVD) media, no floppy drives and no fans (the device is passively cooled).  An ATA interface is unnecessary due to the lack of hard drive.  There is also no PC card slot, although an SD slot is available, as well as USB ports.
A built-in hand-crank generator was part of the notebook in the original design, however it is now an optional clamp-on peripheral (See a photo in the Gallery, below).[tpl]cite news|author = Stephen Shankland|url = http://www.news.com/Negroponte-Slimmer-Linux-needed-for-100-laptop/2100-7346_3-6057456.html |title = Negroponte: Slimmer Linux needed for $100 laptop |publisher = CNET |date = 2006-04-04 |accessdate = 2007-12-24[/tpl]

====Power consumption====

The laptop design specification goals are consumption of about 2 W of power during normal use, far less than the 10 W to 45 W of conventional laptops.John Markoff (November 30, 2006), For $150, Third-World laptop stirs big debate. The New York Times, 30 November 2006.  With build 656, power consumption is between 5 and 8 watts measured on G1G1 laptop. Future software builds are expected to meet the 2-watt target.
In e-book mode (XO 1.5), all hardware sub-systems except the monochrome dual-touch display are powered down. When the user moves to a different page, the other systems wake up, render the new page on the display, and then go back to sleep. Power consumption in this e-book mode is estimated to be 0.3 to 0.8 W. The XO 2.0 is planned to consume even less power than earlier versions, less than 1.0 W in full color mode.
Power options include batteries, solar power panels, and human-powered generators, which make the XO self-powered equipment. 10 batteries at once can be charged from the school building power in the XO multi-battery charger (see photo). The low power consumption combined with these power options are useful in many countries that lack a power infrastructure where students would use it.

====Display====

The first-generation OLPC laptops have a novel low-cost LCD. Later generations of the OLPC laptop are expected to use low-cost, low-power and high-resolution color displays with an appearance similar to electronic paper.
The display is the most expensive component in most laptops. In April 2005, Negroponte hired Mary Lou Jepsen—who was interviewing to join the Media Arts and Sciences faculty at the MIT Media Lab in September 2008[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.joeinc.tv/bio/bio.htm | title = Mary Lou Jepsen Bio|publisher = Mary Lou Jepsen, Ph.D.|date = December 3, 2007 [/tpl]—as OLPC Chief Technology Officer. Jepsen developed a new display for the first-generation OLPC laptop, inspired by the design of small LCDs used in portable DVD players, which she estimated would cost about $35. In the OLPC XO-1, the screen is estimated to be the second most expensive component (after the CPU and chipset).[tpl]cite web | url=http://texyt.com/OLPC+profit+$100+laptop+manufacturing+notebook+developing+world+negroponte | title = Companies make 5–10% profit from not for profit initiative | accessdate=2008-09-09[/tpl]
Jepsen has described the removal of the filters that color the RGB subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new LCD. Instead of using subtractive color filters, the display uses a plastic diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate each pixel.[tpl]Dubious|date=December 2008[/tpl] This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make DVDs. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding pixel with R, G or B. This innovation results in a much brighter display for a given amount of backlight illumination: while the color filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light. Most LCD screens use cold cathode fluorescent lamp backlights which are fragile, difficult or impossible to repair, require a high voltage power supply, are relatively power-hungry, and account for 50% of the screens' cost (sometimes 60%). The LED backlight in the XO-1 is easily replaceable, rugged, and inexpensive.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2008/2192536.htm|title= One laptop per child|accessdate= 1/4 2008|last= Negroponte|first= Nicholas |year= 2008|month= March|format= Lecture|American Association for the Advancement of Science[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/003707.html | title = One Laptop Per Child – a Preview of the Hundred Dollar Laptop|publisher = Worldchanging|date = November 3, 2005 [/tpl]
The remainder of the LCD uses existing display technology and can be made using existing manufacturing equipment. Even the masks can be made using combinations of existing materials and processes. thumb|300px|Comparison of the XO-1 display (left) with a typical liquid crystal display (LCD). The images show 1×1 mm of each screen. A typical LCD addresses groups of 3 locations as pixels. The OLPC XO LCD addresses each location as a separate pixel.

=====Display resolution=====

When lit primarily from the rear with the white LED backlight, the display shows a color image composed of both RGB and grayscale information.[tpl]cite web | url = http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Display#Our_screen.2C_described_by_its_parts | title = Our screen, described by its parts | author = Mary Lou Jepsen | accessdate = 2008-06-16 [/tpl] When lit primarily from the front by ambient light, for example from the sun, the display shows a monochromatic (black and white) image composed of just the grayscale information.
"Mode" change occurs by varying the relative amounts backlight and ambient light. With more backlight, a higher chrominance is available and a color image display is seen. As ambient light levels, such as sunlight, exceed the backlight, a grayscale display is seen; this can be useful when reading e-books for an extended time in bright light such as sunlight. The backlight brightness can also be adjusted to vary the level of color seen in the display and to conserve battery power.
In color mode (when lit primarily from the rear), the display does not use the common RGB pixel geometry for liquid crystal computer displays, in which each pixel contains three tall thin rectangles of the primary colors. Instead, the XO-1 display provides one color for each pixel. The colors align along diagonals that run from upper-right to lower left (see diagram on the right). To reduce the color artifacts caused by this pixel geometry, the color component of the image is blurred by the display controller as the image is sent to the screen. Despite the color blurring, the display still has high resolution for its physical size; normal displays [tpl]As of|2007|alt=as of February 2007[/tpl] put about 588(H)×441(V) to 882(H)×662(V) pixels in this amount of physical area[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] and support subpixel rendering for slightly higher perceived resolution. A Philips Research study measured the XO-1 display's perceived color resolution as effectively 984(H)×738(V).[tpl]cite conference  | first = Michiel  | last = Klompenhouwer  | coauthor = Erno H.A. Langendijk  | title = Comparing the Effective Resolution of Various RGB Subpixel Layouts  | publisher = Society for Information Display Annual Meeting  | date = 2008-05-27  | location = Los Angeles, California  | url = http://www.sid.org/conf/sid2008/program/symposium.html  | id = SID08  |doi=10.1889/1.3069822 | accessdate = 2008-06-16[/tpl][ref]
</ref> A conventional liquid crystal display with the same number of green pixels (green carries most brightness or luminance information for human eyes) as the OLPC XO-1 would be 693×520.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] Unlike a standard RGB LCD, resolution of the XO-1 display varies with angle. Resolution is greatest from upper-right to lower left, and lowest from upper-left to lower-right. Images which approach or exceed this resolution will lose detail and gain color artifacts. The display gains resolution when in bright light; this comes at the expense of color (as the backlight is overpowered) and color resolution can never reach the full 200 dpi sharpness of grayscale mode because of the blur which is applied to images in color mode.

====Wireless mesh networking====

IEEE 802.11b support will be provided using a Wi-Fi “Extended Range” chip set. Jepsen has said the wireless chip set will be run at a low bit rate, 2 Mbit/s maximum rather than the usual higher speed 5.5 Mbit/s or 11 Mbit/s to minimize power consumption. The conventional IEEE 802.11b system only handles traffic within a local cloud of wireless devices in a manner similar to an Ethernet network. Each node transmits and receives its own data, but does not route packets between two nodes that cannot communicate directly. The OLPC laptop will use IEEE 802.11s to form the wireless mesh network.
Whenever the laptop is powered on it can participate in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) with each node operating in a peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear, forwarding packets across the cloud[tpl]When|date=October 2009[/tpl]. If a computer in the cloud has access to the Internet—either directly or indirectly—then all computers in the cloud are able to share that access. The data rate across this network will not be high; however, similar networks, such as the store and forward Motoman project[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E1D91738F935A15752C0A9629C8B63 |title=Technology; E-Mail on Wheels – New York Times |accessdate=2008-01-25 | work=The New York Times | first=James | last=Brooke | date=January 26, 2004[/tpl] have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications (such as email) to communicate outside the cloud; interactive uses, such as web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming should be possible inside the cloud. The IP assignment for the meshed network is intended to be automatically configured, so no server administrator or an administration of IP addresses is needed.
Building a MANET is still untested under the OLPC's current configuration and hardware environment. Although one goal of the laptop is that all of its software be open source, the source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source.  While there are open-source alternatives such as OLSR or B.A.T.M.A.N., none of these options is yet available running at the data-link layer (Layer 2) on the Wi-Fi subsystem's co-processor; this is critical to OLPC's power efficiency scheme. Whether Marvell Technology Group, the producer of the wireless chip set and owner of the current meshing protocol software, will make the firmware open source is still an unanswered question. As of 2011, it has not done so.

====Shell====

Yves Behar is the chief designer of the present XO shell. The shell of the laptop is resistant to dirt and moisture, and is constructed with 2 mm thick plastic (50% thicker than typical laptops). It contains a pivoting, reversible display, movable rubber WiFi antennas, and a sealed rubber-membrane keyboard.

==== Keyboard and touchpad ====

More than twenty different keyboards have been laid out, to suit local needs to match the standard keyboard for the country in which a laptop is intended.  Around half of these have been manufactured for prototype machines.OLPC Keyboard layouts, OLPC Wiki There are parts of the world which do not have a standard keyboard representing their language.  As Negroponte states this is “because there's no real commercial interest in making a keyboard”.ABC. (2008, March 22). The Science Show: One Laptop Per Child. Retrieved May 7, 2008, from http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2008/2192536.htm One example of where the OLPC has bridged this gap is in creating an Amharic keyboardOLPC (2008, April 21).

Negroponte has demanded that the keyboard not contain a caps lock key, which frees up keyboard space for new keys such as a future "view source" key.Don Marti (October 27, 2006),Doing it for the kids, man: Children's laptop inspires open source projects, LinuxWorld.com.  Retrieved on December 25, 2007.
Beneath the keyboard was a large area that resembled a very wide touchpad that Jepsen referred to as the "mousepad".[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl] The capacitive portion of the mousepad was an Alps GlidePoint trackpad,http://wiki.laptop.org/images/b/b0/KGDMFA001-non-confidential.pdf, 7 March 2011http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Disassembly_bottom#Removing_the_ALPS_.28touchpad_and_keyboard_control.29_board, 7 March 2011 which was in the central third of the sensor and could be used with a finger.  The full width was a resistive sensor which, though never supported by software, was intended to be used with a stylus. This unusual feature was eliminated in the CL1A hardware revision because it suffered from erratic pointer motion.  Alps Electronics provided both the capacitive and resistive components of the mousepad.

===Software===

Countries are expected to remove and add software to best adapt the laptop to the local laws and educational needs. As supplied by OLPC, all of the software on the laptop will be free and open source. All core software is intended to be localized to the languages of the target countries.Localization.

* A word processor based on AbiWord.
* Email through the web-based Gmail service.
* Online chat and VoIP programs.
* Python 2.5 is the primary programming language used to develop Sugar "Activities". Several other interpreted programming languages are included, such as JavaScript, Csound, the eToys version of Squeak, and Turtle ArtTurtle Art is a visual programming language that, like Logo, manipulates an on-screen turtle.

* Audio and video player software: Totem or Helix.
The laptop will use the Sugar graphical user interface, written in Python, on top of the X Window System and the Matchbox window manager. This interface is not based on the typical desktop metaphor but presents an iconic view of programs and documents and a map-like view of nearby connected users. The current active program is displayed in full-screen mode. Much of the core Sugar interface uses icons, bypassing localization issues. Sugar is also defined as having no folders present in the UI.
Steve Jobs had offered Mac OS X free of charge for use in the laptop, but according to Seymour Papert, a professor emeritus at MIT who is one of the initiative's founders, the designers wanted an operating system that can be tinkered with: “We declined because it’s not open source.”[tpl]cite news | url = http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113193305149696140-442o71jo_IlBrLpyUeeOdsqDs7E_20061113.html | title = The $100 Laptop Moves Closer to Reality|publisher = Wall Street Journal|date = November 14, 2005 | accessdate = | first=Steve | last=Stecklow[/tpl] Therefore Linux was chosen.

Jim Gettys, responsible for the laptops' system software, has called for a re-education of programmers, saying that many applications use too much memory or even leak memory. “There seems to be a common fallacy among programmers that using memory is good: on current hardware it is often much faster to recompute values than to have to reference memory to get a precomputed value. A full cache miss can be hundreds of cycles, and hundreds of times the power consumption of an instruction that hits in the first level cache.”[tpl]cite web | url = http://lwn.net/Articles/188060/ | title = Interview: Jim Gettys (Part I)|publisher = LWN.net|date = June 28, 2006 | accessdate = [/tpl]
On August 4, 2006, the Wikimedia Foundation announced that static copies of selected Wikipedia articles would be included on the laptops. Jimmy Wales, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, said that "OLPC's mission goes hand in hand with our goal of distributing encyclopedic knowledge, free of charge, to every person in the world. Not everybody in the world has access to a broadband connection."[tpl]cite press release | title = One Laptop Per Child Includes Wikipedia on $100 Laptops; Subset of online encyclopedia to be available in static version to children and teachers in developing world | date = 4 April 2006 | url = http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/One_Laptop_Per_Child_Includes_Wikipedia_on_$100_Laptops|publisher = Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate = [/tpl] Negroponte had earlier suggested he would like to see Wikipedia on the laptop.

The laptop's security architecture, known as Bitfrost, was publicly introduced in February 2007. No passwords will be required for ordinary use of the machine. Programs are assigned certain bundles of rights at install time which govern their access to resources; users can later add more rights. Optionally, the laptops can be configured to request leases from a central server and to stop functioning when these leases expire; this is designed as a theft-prevention mechanism.
The pre-8.20 software versions were criticized for bad wireless connectivity and other minor issues.http://www.olpcnews.com/software/sugar/criticism_and_rebuttal_on_suga.html

====Desktop environments====

Xfce is a lightweight alternative GUI to Sugar. Being only 33 MB (using yum) it does not take up much of an XO's storage space — less than GNOME or KDE.  According to the OLPC Wiki: "Xfce is a lightweight but powerful desktop environment that will work well on the XO"OLPC:OLPC Wiki Information on installation is available at: OLPC Wiki: Xfce.The XO is also now available dual boot and can run a version of MS Windows.
