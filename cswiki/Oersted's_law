In physics and electrical engineering, Oersted's Law (Orsted's observation in 1819) first confirmed the connection between magnetism and electricity. "In that year the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851) observed that a pivoted magnet (a compass needle) was deflected when in the neighborhood of a wire carrying a current" Sears and Zemansky 1964:671. 
This is the first of two major discoveries of physics that yield the fundamental laws of electromagnetic theory, the second is Faraday's law of induction:
:"The work of Oersted thus demonstrated that magnetic effects could be produced by moving electric charges, and that of Faraday and Henry that currents could be produced by moving magnets.
:"It is believed at the present time that all so-called magnetic phenomena result from forces between electric charges in motion. That is, charges in motion relative to an observer set up a magnetic field as well as an electrostatic field, and this magnetic field exerts a force on a second charge in motion relative to the observer . . .  The possibility that the magnetic properties of matter were the result of tiny atomic currents was first suggested by Ampere in 1820."Italics added to in motion for emphasis; other italics are in the original; Sears and Zemansky 1964:671
