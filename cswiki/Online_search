Online search is the process of interactively searching for and retrieving requested information via a computer from databases that are online. Interactive searches became possible in the 1980's with the advent of faster databases and smart terminals. In contrast, computerized batch searching was prevalent in the 1960's and 1970's. Today, searches through web search engines constitute the majority of online searches.
Online searches often supplement reference transactions.
