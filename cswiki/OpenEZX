OpenEZX is a project, which tries to gather information about the Linux based Motorola EZX phone platform.
It tries to provide a 100% free software stack for those phones, especially a way to avoid any proprietary filesystem and/or device drivers. It also aims to provide a current (2.6.x) kernel with all required hardware support for the EZX phones.OpenEZX official website
