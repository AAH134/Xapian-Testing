OpenIDM is a free, open source identity management system written in the Java programming language. The OpenIDM source code is available under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). OpenIDM is designed with flexibility in mind, leverages JavaScript as default scripting language to define business rules during provisioning. All capabilities of OpenIDM exposes RESTful interfaces. As an integration layer, OpenIDM leverages the Identity Connectors (adopted by ForgeRock as OpenICF) and has a set of default connectors.

== History ==

ForgeRock launched the OpenIDM project in October 27 following a 6 month internal development process at GOSCON in Portland.
ForgeRock felt there was no strong open source identity provisioning project, and launched OpenIDM under CDDL licensing for compatibility with OpenAM and OpenDJ.
Full leveraging the Open Source project Identity Connector Framework from Sun Microsystems as integration layer to resources, ForgeRock announced to adopt the project and forming a community around the framework, all under the new name OpenICF.
Gartner identifies ForgeRock OpenIDM as an interesting option to many organizations seeking alternatives to large IAM vendors in their Magic Quadrant for User Administration/Provisioning published December 22, 2011.
January 17, 2012 ForgeRock announces OpenIDM 2.0 which is latest stable release of OpenIDM.
