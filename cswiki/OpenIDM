OpenIDM is a free, open source identity management system written in the Java programming language. The OpenIDM source code is available under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). OpenIDM is designed with flexibility in mind, leverages JavaScript as default scripting language to define business rules during provisioning. All capabilities of OpenIDM exposes RESTful interfaces. As an integration layer, OpenIDM leverages the Identity Connectors (adopted by ForgeRock as OpenICF) and has a set of default connectors.
