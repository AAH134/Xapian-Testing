OpenSocial is a public specification that defines a component hosting environment (container) and a set of common application programming interfaces (APIs) for web-based applications.  Initially it was designed for social network applications and was developed by Google along with MySpace and a number of other social networks.  In more recent times it has become adopted as a general use runtime environment for allowing untrusted and partially trusted components from third parties to run in an existing web application.  The OpenSocial Foundation has also moved to integrate or support numerous other open web technologies.  This includes Oauth and OAuth 2.0, Activity Streams, and portable contacts, among others.
It was released November 1, 2007.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/opensocial.html |title=Google Launches OpenSocial to Spread Social Applications Across the Web |accessdate=2007-10-31 |date=2007-11-01 |publisher=Google |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] 
Applications implementing the OpenSocial APIs will be interoperable with any social network system that supports them, including features on sites such as Hi5.com, 99factors.com, MySpace,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/myspace_opensocial.html |title=MySpace and Google Join Forces to Launch Open Platform for Social Application Development |accessdate=2007-11-02 |date=2007-11-01 |publisher=Google |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] orkut, Netlog,[tpl]cite web |url=http://en.netlog.com/go/developer/opensocial |title= Developer / OpenSocial |accessdate=2008-09-17 |publisher=Netlog |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Sonico.com,[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.sonico.com/boletin/opensocial-week-exitoso-paso-por-argentina/ |title=OpenSocial Week: Exitoso paso por Argentina |accessdate=2008-06-05 |date=2008-05-05 |publisher=Sonico |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Friendster,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/technology/02google.html |title=MySpace Joins Google Alliance to Counter Facebook |accessdate=2007-11-02 |last=Helft |first=Miguel |coauthors=Brad Stone |date=2007-11-02 |work=New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Ning, and Yahoo!.

==Structure==

Based on HTML and JavaScript, as well as the Google Gadgets framework, OpenSocial includes multiple APIs for social software applications to access data and core functions on participating social networks.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/open-social-a-n.html |title=Open Social: a new universe of social applications all over the web |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Andreessen |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Andreessen |date=2007-10-31 |work=blog.pmarca.com |publisher= |doi= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071102041108/http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/open-social-a-n.html  |archivedate = 2007-11-02 |quote= [/tpl] Each API addresses a different aspect:.[tpl]cite web |url=http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/index.html |title=OpenSocial API Documentation |accessdate=2007-11-02 |work=Google Code |publisher=Google |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]  It also includes APIs for contacting arbitrary third party services on the web using a proxy system and OAuth for security.
In version 0.9 OpenSocial added support for a tag-based language.[tpl]cite web |url=http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/2.0/OpenSocial-Specification-Release-Notes.xml#rfc.section.4 |title=OpenSocial Specification Release Notes|accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]  This language is referred to as OSML and allows tag-based access to data from the OpenSocial APIs that previously required an asynchronous client side request.  It also defined a rich tag template system and adopted an expression language loosely based on the Java Expression Language.
Starting in version 2.0 OpenSocial adopted support for Activity Streams format [tpl]cite web |url=http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/2.0/OpenSocial-Specification-Release-Notes.xml#OpenSocial20 |title=OpenSocial Specification Release Notes|accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]

==History==

===Development===

OpenSocial was rumored to be part of a larger social networking initiative by Google code-named "Maka-Maka",[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/29/googles-response-to-facebook-maka-maka/ |title=Google’s Response to Facebook: "Maka-Maka" |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Schonfeld |first=Erick |date=2007-10-29 |work=TechCrunch |publisher= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] which is defined as meaning "intimate friend with whom one is on terms of receiving and giving freely" in Hawaiian.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wehewehe.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/hdict?d=D12283 |title=maka.maka |accessdate=2007-11-01 |author= |coauthors= |date= |work=Nā Puke Wehewehe ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi |publisher=Ulukau: The Hawaiian Electronic Library |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]

===Implementation===

For launch, partnershttp://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/partners.html committed to supporting the OpenSocial APIs included the social network companies Bebo, Engage.com,http://engage.com Friendster, hi5, Hyves, imeem, NetModular,http://netmodular.com mixi, MySpace, Ning, orkut, Plaxo, QuePasa, phpFox, Six Apart, Freebar.com;http://www.freebar.com as well as business-oriented networking companies LinkedIn, Tianji, Salesforce.com, Viadeo,http://viadeo.com Oracle, and XING. Plaxo and Ning released OpenSocial support within the first day of the launch, with Plaxo adding OpenSocial support to its Pulse feature,[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/2007/11/opensocial_is_n.html |title=OpenSocial is now live on Plaxo Pulse |accessdate=2007-11-04 |last=Smarr |first=Joseph |date=2007-11-01 |work=Plaxo's Personal Card |publisher=Plaxo |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] and Ning adding basic OpenSocial support ahead of its previously announced release[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.ning.com/2007/11/andwere_live_with_opensocial_g.html |title=And ... We're Live with OpenSocial! |accessdate=2007-11-04 |last=Bianchini |first=Gina |date=2007-11-02 |work= |publisher=Ning |doi= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071212234351/http://blog.ning.com/2007/11/andwere_live_with_opensocial_g.html  |archivedate = 2007-12-12 |quote= [/tpl] of full support in late 2007 to early 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.ning.com/2007/10/open_social_ning_coming_early.html |title=OpenSocial & Ning |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Bianchini |first=Gina |date=2007-10-31 |work= |publisher=Ning |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] 
Developers who had already built applications implementing the APIs upon launch include Flixster, FotoFlexer, iLike, Newsgator,http://www.newsgator.com RockYou,http://rockyou.com Slide, Theikos,http://theikos.com/ and VirtualTourist. Initial OpenSocial support experienced vulnerabilities in security, with a self-described amateur developer demonstrating exploits of the RockYou gadget on Plaxo, and of Ning social networks using the iLike gadget.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/05/opensocial-hacked-again |title=OpenSocial Hacked Again |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Arrington |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Arrington |date=2007-11-05 |format= |work= |publisher=TechCrunch |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] On Mar 25, 2008 Yahoo! also announced it has joined the initiative.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSN2539603020080325 | work=Reuters | title=UPDATE 1-Yahoo supports Google social network applications | first=Anupreeta | last=Das | date=2008-03-25[/tpl] Next to that, an extension of the OpenSocial specification is used in Responsive Open Learning Environments (ROLE) to support the assembling of widgets and resources into PLEs while providing responsive functionality.
An open source project, Shindig, was launched in December, 2007, to provide a reference implementation of the OpenSocial standards. It has the support of Google, Ning, and other companies developing OpenSocial-related software.  The Myspace OpenSocial parser was released as project Negroni in January, 2011 and provides a C# based implementation of OpenSocial.

===Criticism of Initial Release===

Opened to much fanfare in news coverage, OpenSocial did not work well in the beginning; it only ran on Google-owned Orkut, and only with a limited number of gadgets, returning errors for other gadgets. Other networks were still looking into implementing the framework.
As reported by TechCrunch on November 5, 2007, OpenSocial was also quickly cracked. The total time to crack the OpenSocial-based iLike on Ning was just 20 minutes, according to TechCrunch, with the attacker being able to add and remove songs on a user's playlist, and to look into information on their friends.[tpl]cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2007/11/05/opensocial-hacked-again/ |title=OpenSocial Hacked Again |accessdate=2010-07-24 |last=Arrington |first=Michael |date=2007-11-05 |work=TechCrunch |publisher= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]
On December 6, TechCrunch followed up with a report by MediaPops founder Russ Whitman, who said "While we were initially very excited, we have learned the hard way just how limited the release truly is." Russ added that "core functionality components" are missing and that "write once, distribute broadly" was not accurate.[tpl]cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2007/12/06/opensocial-still-not-open-for-business/ |title=OpenSocial Still "Not Open for Business" |accessdate=2010-07-24 |last=Schonfeld |first=Erick |date=2007-12-06 |work=TechCrunch |publisher= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]

===Background===

OpenSocial is commonly described as a more open cross-platform alternative to the Facebook Platform, a proprietary service of the popular social network service Facebook.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/technology/31google.html |title=Google and Friends to Gang Up on Facebook |accessdate=2007-10-31 |author= |last=Helft |first=Miguel |authorlink= |coauthors=Brad Stone |date=2007-10-31 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] After launching Facebook Platform in late May 2007,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=3102 |title=Facebook Unveils Platform for Developers of Social Applications |accessdate=2007-11-06 |date=2007-05-24 |publisher=Facebook |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] as well as acquiring startup web desktop company Parakey in mid-July 2007,[tpl]cite web |url=http://ads.ak.facebook.com/ads/press/Parakey_Press_Release.pdf |title=Facebook Acquires Startup Parakey |accessdate=2007-11-06 |date=2007-07-19 |publisher=Facebook |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |format=PDF[/tpl] the fast-growing Facebook has been widely reported as a challenger to Google[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04digi.html |title=Why Google Turned Into a Social Butterfly |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Stross |first=Randall |authorlink= |date=2007-11-04 |work=New York Times: Digital Domain |publisher=The New York Times Company |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] in establishing and leveraging a ubiquitous web operating system.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.redherring.com/Home/23046 |title=Is Facebook An Operating System? |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Dreyfuss |first=Joel |date=2007-10-26 |work= |publisher=Red Herring |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/19/could-facebook-become-the-next-microsoft/ |title=Could Facebook Become The Next Microsoft? |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Riley |first=Duncan |date=2007-07-19 |publisher=TechCrunch |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Compared to Facebook, which is ranked second by page views worldwide for the month of September 2007, Google's social network orkut is ranked sixth for the same month, with more than half its members living in Brazil.
Reports on competition between the two companies increased with Facebook scheduling an announcement of an online advertising initiative (named Facebook Ads) the day after Google's social networking announcement was originally scheduled[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/30/facebooks-social-ad-network-what-we-think-we-know-so-far/ |title=Facebook’s Social Ad Network: What We (Think We) Know So Far |accessdate=2007-07-06 |last=Schonfeld |first=Erick |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=TechCrunch |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] (November 6, 2007[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=9176 |title=Facebook Unveils Facebook Ads |accessdate=2007-11-06 |date=2007-11-06 |publisher=Facebook |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]). The initiative includes ad serving and targeting programs (named Facebook Social Ads and Facebook Insights, respectively) in competition with Google's market-leading AdSense and AdWords programs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2007/11/06/facebook-vs-google/ |title=Why Is Google Afraid of Facebook? |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Malik |first=Om |authorlink=Om Malik |date=2007-11-06 |work=GigaOm |publisher=GigaOmniMedia |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2007/11/01/newsgator-opensocial/ |title=Newsgator Joins OpenSocial |accessdate=2008-01-24 |last=Nicole |first=Kristen |authorlink=Kristen Nicole |date=2007-11-01 |work=Mashable |publisher=Federated Media Publishing |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]
