The Open Mashup Alliance (OMA) is a non-profit consortium that promotes the adoption of mashup solutions in the enterprise through the evolution of enterprise mashup standards like  EMML.[tpl]cite web|title=Open Mashup Alliance FAQs |url=http://www.openmashup.org/faq[/tpl]  Enterprise mashup usage is expected to grow tenfold in the next five years.[tpl]when|see WP:RELTIME|date=December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Enterprise mashup market to increase tenfold over next five years |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/service-oriented/?p=2942[/tpl] The initial members of the OMA include some large technology companies such as Adobe Systems, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel, and some major technology users such as Bank of America and Capgemini.
According to information technology industry analyst Dion Hinchcliffe,[tpl]cite web|title=Creating a unified model for enterprise mashups |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=872[/tpl] "Ultimately, the OMA creates a standardized approach to enterprise mashups that creates an open and vibrant market for competing runtimes, mashups, and an array of important aftermarket services such as development/testing tools, management and administration appliances, governance frameworks, education, professional services, and so on."

==Specification development==

The initial focus of the OMA is developing EMML, which is a declarative mashup domain-specific language (DSL) aimed at creating enterprise mashups.
The EMML language provides a comprehensive set of high-level mashup-domain vocabulary to consume and mash variety of Web data-sources in diverse ways. EMML provides a uniform syntax to invoke heterogeneous service styles: REST, WSDL, RSS/ATOM, RDBMS, and POJO. EMML also provides ability to mix and match diverse data-formats: XML, JSON, JDBC, JavaObjects, and primitive types.
The OMA Web site provides the EMML specification,[tpl]cite web | title = OMA Download Agreement Page | url = http://www.openmashup.org/download/agreement.html[/tpl] the EMML schema,[tpl]cite web | title = EMML Schema | url = http://www.openmashup.org/schemas/v1.0/EMMLSpec.xsd[/tpl] a reference runtime implementation capable of running EMML scripts, sample EMML mashup scripts, and technical documentation.[tpl]cite web | title = EMML Technical Documentation | url = http://www.openmashup.org/omadocs/v1.0/index.html[/tpl]
