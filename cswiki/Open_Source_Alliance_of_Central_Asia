The Open Source Alliance of Central Asia (OSACA) was founded at the first Regional Open Source Conference for Central Asia (ROSCCA 2011), that took place in Kabul, Afghanistan from 15 to 18 October 2011.
The Alliance is open to members belonging to a wide range of countries, starting from - but not limited to - those once served by the historical Silk Roads, connecting the East and the West, as well as the North and the South of the Eurasian continent. It focuses on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and its advocacy and dissemination, in order to facilitate cultural, social, and economic development in the area of concern.
