==History==

Opera began in 1994 as a research project at Telenor, the largest Norwegian telecommunications company. In 1995, it branched out into a separate company named Opera Software ASA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/company/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071203140601/http://www.opera.com/company/about/|title=About Opera|publisher=Opera Software|archivedate=3 December 2007|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] Opera was first released publicly with version 2.0 in 1996,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foxkeh.com/downloads/history/history-original.pdf|format=PDF|title=Affiliated Organization of Firefox and Mozilla|publisher=Mozilla Foundation|work=Mozilla Japan|year=2006|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] which only ran on Microsoft Windows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/company/history/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071123104427/http://www.opera.com/company/about/milestones/|title=Milestones|publisher=Opera Software|archivedate=23 November 2007|accessdate=13 January 2011|year=2007[/tpl] In an attempt to capitalize on the emerging market for Internet-connected handheld devices, a project to port Opera to mobile device platforms was started in 1998. Opera 4.0, released in 2000, included a new cross-platform core that facilitated creation of editions of Opera for multiple operating systems and platforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.markschenk.com/various/ohistory/index.html|title=Opera browser version history|last=Schenk|first=Mark|year=2010|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Up to this point, Opera was trialware and had to be purchased after the trial period ended. Version 5.0 (released in 2000) saw the end of this requirement. Instead, Opera became ad-sponsored, displaying advertisements to users who had not paid for it.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/06/opera_browser_goes_free/|title=Opera browser goes free with version 5.0 launch|last=Lettice|first=John|publisher=The Register|date=6 December 2000|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] Later versions of Opera gave the user the choice of seeing banner ads or targeted text advertisements from Google. With version 8.5 (released in 2005) the advertisements were removed entirely and primary financial support for the browser came through revenue from Google (which is by contract Opera's default search engine).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/opera-goes-free-with-help-from-google/2227/|title=Opera Goes Free with Help from Google|last=Baker|first=Loren|publisher=Search Engine Journal|date=20 September 2005|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Among the new features introduced in version 9.1 (released in 2006) was fraud protection using technology from GeoTrust, a digital certificate provider, and PhishTank, an organization that tracks known phishing web sites.[tpl]cite web|url=http://operawatch.com/news/2006/12/opera-91-is-out-with-fraud-protection.html|title=Opera 9.1 is out with Fraud Protection|last=Goldman|first=Daniel|publisher=Opera Watch|date=18 December 2006|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
This feature was further improved and expanded in version 9.5, when GeoTrust was replaced with Netcraft, and malware protection from Haute Secure was added.[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2008/06/06/malware-protection|title=Malware protection|last=Kleinhout|first=Huib|publisher=Opera Software|work=Opera Desktop Team|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Also in 2006, editions of Opera were made and released for Nintendo's DS and Wii gaming systems.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2006/02/15/|title=Giving gamers two windows to the Web: The Opera Browser for Nintendo DS|publisher=Opera Software|date=15 February 2006|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2007/06/08/|title=Nintendo DS Browser available to North American market|publisher=Opera Software|date=8 June 2007|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] Opera for the Wii, called the Internet Channel, was free to download from its release on 12 April 2007[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2007/04/12/|title=Get to Know the Web on Wii: Full Version of Wii Internet Channel Powered by Opera Available for Free Download|publisher=Opera Software|date=12 April 2007|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] until 30 June 2007.

The Nintendo DS Browser is not free; it is sold as a physical DS game cartridge. The DSi has an Internet Channel that can be downloaded for free from the DSi shop.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000OAO494|title=Nintendo DS Lite Browser|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
A new JavaScript engine called Carakan, after the Javanese script, was introduced with version 10.50.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/1050/|title=Opera 10.50 for Windows changelog (Final)|date=2 March 2010|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] According to Opera Software, Carakan is more than seven times faster in SunSpider than Opera 10.10 with Futhark on Windows, which has since been more or less confirmed by other sources after its official pre-alpha release in December 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://techie-buzz.com/opera/opera-10-5-pre-alpha-is-here-and-it-is-fast.html|title=Opera 10.5 Pre-Alpha Is Here and It Is Fast!|first=Pallab|last=De|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Techie-buzz.com|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5432054/opera-105-pre+alpha-is-all-about-speed-and-private-browsing|publisher=Lifehacker|title=Opera 10.5 Pre-Alpha is All About Speed (and Private Browsing)|first=Kevin|last=Purdy|date=22 December 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] Also introduced was Opera's vector graphics library, Vega, which handles all of the browser's rendering. This allows platform specific rendering code to be replaced with code for Vega, which makes it easier to deploy across platforms; aids Opera's implementation of some advanced CSS3 properties, such as backgrounds and borders; and also allows hardware acceleration with optional OpenGL and Direct3D backends.[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/chooseopera/blog/2009/02/05/meet-carakan-and-vega|title=Meet Carakan and Vega|last=Øverdahl|first=Espen|publisher=Opera Software|date=5 February 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010|work=Choose Opera[/tpl]
The initial release of Opera 10.50 was for Windows only, in order to allow the development team to focus on a timed release with the EU browser ballot offered to European Economic Area users of Microsoft Windows.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8537763.stm|title=Microsoft offers browser choices to Europeans|publisher=BBC|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] The Mac version reached final status with version 10.52 and the release of Opera 10.60 brought Windows, Mac, Linux and FreeBSD back into sync for the first time since Opera 10.10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2010/07/01/opera-10-60-goes-final|title=Opera 10.60 goes final|work=Opera Desktop Team|last=Kleinhout|first=Huib|date=July 1, 2010|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=September 5, 2010[/tpl]
On December 16, 2010, Opera 11 was released, featuring extensions, tab stacking, visual mouse gestures, and changes to the address field.[tpl]cite web|title=Opera features|url=http://www.opera.com/browser/features/|publisher=Opera ASA|accessdate=19 December 2010[/tpl] The new address field hides some of the whole URL, such as the protocol and query strings, but this can be turned off. Within the first 24 hours of release, Opera 11 was downloaded 6.7 million times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/chooseopera/blog/2010/12/17/what-a-day|title=What a day|publisher=my.opera.com|date=2010-12-17|format=blog[/tpl]

==Features==

As of version 10.5, Opera features a new JavaScript engine, as well as a new vector graphics library, which together significantly increase Opera's overall rendering speed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://labs.opera.com/news/2009/12/22/|title=Opera 10.5 pre-alpha for Labs|work=Opera Labs|publisher=Opera Software|first=Roberto|last=Mateu|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2009/12/22/from-all-of-us-to-all-of-you|title=From all of us to all of you|first=Huib|last=Kleinhout|publisher=Opera Software|work=Opera Desktop Team|date=22 December 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Opera includes built-in tabbed browsing, ad blocking, fraud protection, a download manager and BitTorrent client, a search bar, and a web feed aggregator. Opera also comes with an e-mail client called Opera Mail and an IRC chat client built in.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/browser/|title=Opera browser: Features|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Opera includes a "Speed Dial" feature, which allows the user to add up to 25 links (or more, by editing the speeddial.ini file) shown in thumbnail form in a page displayed when a new tab is opened. Thumbnails of the linked pages are automatically generated and used for visual recognition on the Speed Dial page or can be modified using Opera Image Dial Generator. Once set up, this feature allows the user to more easily navigate to the selected web pages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/04/opera-releases-9-2-browser-adds-speed-dial.ars|title=Opera releases 9.2 browser, adds "Speed Dial"|last=Reimer|first=Jeremy|publisher=Ars Technica|date=12 April 2007|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Opera supports Opera Widgets, small web applications that start from within Opera. Alongside Widgets, "User JavaScript" may be used to add custom JavaScript to web pages. Greasemonkey support is limited, and there is no interface to manage scripts or toggle 'Greasemonkey-on' functionality.
Opera is extensible in a third way via plug-ins, relatively small programs that add specific functions to the browser,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/plugins/|title=Plug-ins|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] and as of Opera 11, third-party extensions. However, Opera limits what plug-ins can do.

===Languages and localization===

Opera is currently available[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.opera.com/download/languagefiles/ |title=Opera browser language files |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Opera |accessdate=11 February 2012[/tpl] in 56 languages and locales: Afrikaans, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bengali, Bulgarian, Czech, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English (UK and US), Estonian, Finnish, French (France and Canadian), West Frisian, Georgian, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Montenegrin, Norwegian (Nynorsk and Bokmål), Polish, Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil), Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Scottish Gaelic, Serbian, Slovak, Spanish (Latin America and Spain), Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Telugu, Turkish, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Vietnamese and Zulu.

===Usability and accessibility===

Opera was designed with a commitment to computer accessibility for users who have visual or motor impairments. As a multimodal browser, it also caters to a wide variety of personal preferences in the user interface.
It is possible to control nearly every aspect of the browser using only the keyboard,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/nomouse/|title=Use Opera without a Mouse|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] and the default keyboard shortcuts can be modified to suit the user.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tntluoma.com/30days/day-16-sessions/|title=Day 16: Sessions|work=30 Days to becoming an Opera8 Lover|date=25 May 2005|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/csant/blog/2007/06/11/emacs-keyboard-bindings-2|title=emacs keyboard bindings - 2|last=Santambrogio|first=Claudio|work=csant/log at My Opera|publisher=Opera Software|date=11 June 2007|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] It is the only major browser to include support for spatial navigation. Opera also includes support for mouse gestures, patterns of mouse movement that trigger browser actions such as "back" or "refresh".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/browser/tutorials/gestures/|title=Mouse Gestures in Opera|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Page zooming allows text, images and other content such as Adobe Flash Player, Java platform and Scalable Vector Graphics to be increased or decreased in size (20% to 1,000%) to help those with impaired vision. The user may also specify the fonts and colors for web pages, and even override the page's CSS styling as well. This can be useful for making sites appear in high contrast or in more readable fonts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/usercss/index.dml|title=Opera: User CSS — Accessibility Layout|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Voice control, co-developed with IBM, allows control of the browser without the use of a keyboard or mouse.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/51622-ibm-opera-to-develop-multimode-browser|title=IBM, Opera To Develop "Multimode" Browser|publisher=Ziff Davis|work=ExtremeTech|date=24 July 2002|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webstandards.org/2004/03/26/opera-ibm-voice/|title=Opera, IBM voice|last=Koltz|first=Holly Marie|publisher=Web Standards Project|date=26 March 2004|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] It can also read aloud pages and marked text.
Opera Turbo is a feature intended for slower internet connections; when enabled, Opera's servers act as a proxy which compresses the requested web page by up to 80% before sending it to the user. This process reduces the total size of the data being sent, and thus shortens the amount of time necessary for the page to load. This technique is also used in Opera Mini.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/business/solutions/turbo/|title=Opera Turbo|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100630190447/http://www.opera.com/business/solutions/turbo/ |archivedate=30 June 2010[/tpl]

===Privacy and security===

Opera has several security features visible to the end user. One is the option to delete private data, such as HTTP cookies, the browsing history, and the cache, with the click of a button. This lets users erase personal data after browsing from a shared computer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tntluoma.com/30days/delete-private-data/|title=Delete Private Data|work=30 Days to becoming an Opera8 Lover|date=23 September 2005|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
When visiting a secure web site, Opera encrypts data using either SSL 3 or TLS,[tpl]cite web|url=http://labs.opera.com/news/2006/05/16/|title=What's new in the SSL/TLS engine of Opera 9?|last=Pettersen|first=Yngve|publisher=Opera Software|date=16 May 2006|accessdate=5 September 2010|work=Opera Labs[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.securityteacher.com/2006/02/18/security-in-opera-browser-a-brief-glance/|last=Pankov|first=Igor|title=Security in Opera Browser: A Brief Glance|publisher=Agnitum Ltd|date=18 February 2006|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] both of which are highly secure encryption protocols. It then adds information about the site's security to the address bar. It will also check the web site that is being visited against blacklists for phishing and malware, and warn if it matches any of these lists. This behavior is enabled by default, but the user may opt to not make such checks automatically. If this check is disabled, the user can still check sites individually by opening a Page Info dialog.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/fraudprotection/|title=Opera Fraud and Malware Protection|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
The user can protect every saved password stored in Opera with a master password. This prevents malware from accessing those passwords unless the master password is known.
Also, Opera does not show saved passwords using password manager unlike Firefox and Chrome.
To catch security flaws and other software bugs before they are exploited or become a serious problem, the Opera Software company maintains a public web form where users can submit bug reports.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/support/bugs/|title=Reporting Bugs|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] According to Secunia, a computer security service provider, the mean average of unpatched vulnerabilities in the last 365 days is 0.01. This stands in contrast to Internet Explorer (38.3), Firefox (5.77), and Safari (1.54).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webdevout.net/browser-security|title=Web browser security summary|first=David|last=Hammond|accessdate=5 September 2010|date=10 February 2009[/tpl]
In January 2007, Asa Dotzler of the competing Mozilla Corporation accused the Opera Software company of downplaying information about security vulnerabilities in Opera that were fixed in December 2006. Dotzler claimed that users were not clearly informed of security vulnerabilities present in the previous version of Opera, and thus they would not realize that they needed to upgrade to the latest version or risk being exploited.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3653031|title=Mozilla Takes Aim at Opera Security|last=Kerner|first=Sean Michael|publisher=Quinstreet|work=Internetnews.com|date=9 January 2007|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]
Opera responded to these accusations the next day.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3653226|title=Opera Has Words For Mozilla|last=Kerner|first=Sean Michael|publisher=Quinstreet|work=Internetnews.com|date=10 January 2007|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl]

===Standards support===

Opera was one of the first browsers to support Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), now a major building block of web design.[tpl]cite web|url=http://meyerweb.com/eric/articles/webrev/199906.html|title=CSS: If not now, when?|first=Eric|last=Meyer|authorlink=Eric Meyer|publisher=meyerweb.com|month=June|year=1999|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] Today, Opera supports many web standards, including CSS 2.1, HTML 5, XHTML 1.1, XHTML Basic, XHTML Mobile Profile, XHTML+Voice, WML 2.0, XSLT, XPath, XSL-FO, ECMAScript 5.1 (JavaScript), DOM 2, XMLHttpRequest, HTTP 1.1, TLS 1.2,[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2009/02/25/new-in-opera-presto-2-2-tls-1-2-support|title=New in Opera Presto 2.2: TLS 1.2 Support|last=Pettersen|first=Yngve Nysæter|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010|work=Opera Core Concerns|date=25 February 2009[/tpl] Unicode, SVG 1.1 Basic, SVG 1.1 Tiny, GIF89a, JPEG, and full support for PNG, including alpha transparency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/|title=Web Specifications Supported in Opera 9|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] Since version 9, Opera passes the Acid2 test, a test of whether or not a browser properly supports certain web standards.

On the official CSS 2.1 test suite by standardization organization W3C, Opera's rendering engine Presto passes 89.37% (77.44% out of 86.65%) of covered CSS 2.1 tests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS2.1/20110323/reports/results.html|title=CSS 2.1 Test Suite RC6 Results|accessdate=May 31, 2011|publisher=W3C[/tpl]

===Opera Unite===

Opera Unite is an extensible framework that allows for several web services (referred to as "Applications"[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2009/09/21/unite-applications|title=Unite Apps are coming ever closer...|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010|publisher=Opera Software|work=Opera Desktop Team|first=Daniel|last=Aleksandersen|quote=We are re-branding Unite Services as Unite Applications in the name of simplicity[/tpl]) to be hosted from the user's computer, including a web server for hosting a site, file and photo sharing, a chat room, and streaming media. Opera Software has released an API to create new or improved applications for the Opera Unite Platform, and many have already done so. An Opera Unite user's applications run on a domain associated with their My Opera Community account, and are accessible from any web browser. For these applications to be accessed, the computer and the Opera Browser hosting the applications must both be running.

===Smartphones and PDAs===

Opera Mobile is an edition of Opera designed for smartphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The first version of Opera Mobile was released in 2000 for the Psion Series 7 and NetBook, with a port to the Windows Mobile platform coming in 2004.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2000/03/31/|title=mCommerce Now a Reality on Psion Platform|publisher=Opera Software|date=3 April 2000|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://jp.opera.com/products/mobile/brochures/OperaMobileTimeline.pdf|format=PDF|title=Opera Mobile Timeline|publisher=Opera Software|year=2006|accessdate=6 September 2010| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625214351/http://jp.opera.com/products/mobile/brochures/OperaMobileTimeline.pdf| archivedate = June 25, 2008[/tpl] Today, Opera Mobile is available for a variety of devices that run Android, the Windows Mobile, S60 platform, or UIQ operating systems.
Users may also try Opera Mobile free.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/mobile/download/?show=mobile|title=Buy Opera|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=[/tpl] Devices that use the UIQ 3 operating system, such as the Sony Ericsson P990 and Motorola RIZR Z8, come pre-installed with Opera Mobile, the former price of Opera Mobile being included in the price of the phone.
One of Opera Mobile's major features is the ability to dynamically reformat web pages to better fit the handheld's display using small screen rendering technology.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2004/11/23/|title=The new ERA of content rendering: Opera Introduces Fit-to-Window Technology for All Screen Sizes|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=6 September 2010|date=23 November 2004[/tpl] Alternatively, the user may use page zooming for a closer or broader look.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/mobile/tutorials/s60/|title=Opera for Symbian S60|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] However, like previous versions of Opera for personal computers, Opera Mobile's user interface has come under fire for being difficult to use or customize.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smartphonemag.com/cms/index.php?q=blogs/3/prelude_to_the_opera_mobile_vs_netfront|title=Post details: Prelude to the Opera Mobile vs NetFront article — profound differences between the two new Web browsers|last=Ruotsalainen|first=Werner|publisher=Smartphone & Pocket PC magazine|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ivankuznetsov.com/2006/09/opera-mobile-vs.html|title=Opera Mobile vs. Nokia S60 browser — new browser war?|last=Kuznetsov|first=Ivan|date=2 September 2006|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl]

===Mobile phones===

Opera Mini, offered free of charge, is designed primarily for mobile phones, but also for smartphones and personal digital assistants.

===Nintendo DS===

The Nintendo DS Browser is an edition of Opera for the Nintendo DS handheld gaming system. The Nintendo DS Browser was released in Japan on 24 July 2006,[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2006/07/24/|title=Surf in Bed: Nintendo DS Browser hits Japan|publisher=Opera Software|date=24 July 2006|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] in Europe on 6 October 2006,[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2006/10/06/|title=Nintendo DS Browser launches across Europe today|publisher=Opera Software|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] and in North America on 4 June 2007.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid=6170135&part=rss&tag=gs_news&subj=6170135|title=Original DS browser available online only|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|publisher=GameSpot|date=4 May 2007|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] It is sold as a physical game cartridge for US$30.
The Nintendo DS Browser includes the same small screen rendering and page zooming technology present in Opera Mobile. It also includes handwriting recognition software and an on-screen keyboard to enable user input. Additionally, Nintendo partnered with Astaro Internet Security to provide web filtering for the Nintendo DS Browser. The technology is simply a professionally maintained proxy server that blocks web sites related to pornography, discrimination, security hacking, software piracy, violence, gambling, illegal drugs, alcohol, tobacco, dating, weapons, abortion, and other content that Nintendo deems objectionable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.astaro.com/ds-content-filter/|title=Astaro Parental Control for the Nintendo DS Browser|publisher=Astaro|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] Users can configure the Nintendo DS Browser to receive web pages through this proxy server, and this setting can be password-protected (by a parent, for example) to prevent circumvention.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/dslite/browser.jsp#contentFilter|title=Nintendo DS Browser: Content Filtering (proxy server)|work=Customer Service|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl]
In August 2007, the Nintendo DS Browser was quietly discontinued in North America, although it is still available from Nintendo's online store.[tpl]cite web|url=http://store.nintendo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=129204&currency=USD&catalogId=10001&tranId=0&lastAction=setCurr&storeId=10001&languageId=-1&categoryId=58694&ddkey=http://SetCurrencyPreference|title=Nintendo DS Browser (Original Style Nintendo DS)|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl]

===Wii===

On 10 May 2006, the Opera Software company announced that it was partnering with Nintendo to provide a web browser for Nintendo's Wii gaming console. Opera for the Wii, called the Internet Channel, was free to download from its release on 12 April 2007 until 30 June 2007. After that date, Wii users had to pay 500 Wii Points to download it. However, in late August / early September of the year 2009, the Internet Channel was once again available to download for free and those who paid for the service had their Wii Points returned in the form of a free NES virtual console game.
Scott Hedrick, an executive of the Opera Software company, explained that the Wii browser was designed to suit a "living room environment".[tpl]cite web|last=Temperton|first=James|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/5329|title=Interview: Opera's Nintendo Wii Browser|date=3 June 2006|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=Cubed3[/tpl] In contrast to Opera's appearance on computer monitors, fonts are larger and the interface is simplified for easier use. Notwithstanding the changes in design, the Wii browser supports the same web standards as the desktop version of Opera 9, including passing the Acid2 test.[tpl]cite web|url=http://operawatch.com/news/2006/12/wii-browser-passes-the-acid2-test.html|title=Wii browser passes the Acid2 test|last=Goldman|first=Daniel|publisher=Opera Watch|date=22 December 2006|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl]

==Market adoption==

[tpl]as of|2011|12[/tpl] Opera has a 1.3% to 2.6% worldwide usage share of web browsers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_table|title=Usage share of web browsers|publisher=Wikipedia|date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012[/tpl]
The browser has been more successful in Eastern Europe, including about 47% market share in 2009 in Georgia, 43% in Ukraine, 39% in Kazakhstan, 36% in Russia, and 8–11% in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Czech Republic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200901-201001-bar|title=StatCounter Global Stats|publisher=StatCounter|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] Georgia Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic
In July 2011, Opera broke its previous download records when Opera 11.50 was released and was recorded to be downloaded 35 million times during the first week of release.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2011/06/28/|title=Is Opera 11.50 bigger than the Death Star?|publisher=Opera Software|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=11 August 2011[/tpl]
Since its first release in 1996, the browser has had limited success on personal computers. It has had more success in the area of mobile browsing, with product releases for a variety of platforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2007/05/microsofts-silverlight-to-get-opera.ars|title=Microsoft's Silverlight to get Opera compatibility|last=Reimer|first=Jeremy|publisher=Ars Technica|date=10 May 2007|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] Opera Mini had more than 140 million active users in October 2011, and Opera had the highest market share of all mobile browsers, according to StatCounter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Opera-Mini-Now-with-Over-140-Million-Users-236118.shtml|title=Opera Mini Now with Over 140 Million Users|date=23 November 2011|publisher=Softpedia|accessdate=7 December 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_browser-ww-monthly-201110-201110-bar|title=Top Mobile Browsers on October 2011|date=1 November 2011|publisher=StatCounter|accessdate=7 December 2011[/tpl]

Opera technology is now found in Adobe GoLive, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver, and other components of the Adobe Creative Suite. Opera's layout engine is also found in Virtual Mechanics SiteSpinner Pro.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.virtualmechanics.com/company/press1108.html|title=Design Web Pages for the Desktop and Mobile Devices|publisher=Virtual Mechanics Inc.|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl]

==Reception==

Critical reception of Opera has been largely positive,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/hwswrev/software/opera/opera2.htm|title=Software Review: Opera browser for Windows v3.62|last=Mason|first=Wesley|publisher=Geek.com|date=16 March 2000|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://download.cnet.com/Opera/3000-2356_4-10005498.html#editorsreview|title=Editor's review of Opera|publisher=Download.com|accessdate=6 September 2010|first=Seth|last=Rosenblatt|date=1 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.compukiss.com/populartopics/research_infohtm/review386.htm|title=Opera Web Browser|last=Berger|first=Sandy|publisher=CompuKiss|date=3 November 2004|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] although it has been criticized for website compatibility issues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2007/08/31/focus-areas-during-kestrel-development|title=Focus Areas during Kestrel Development|last=Altman|first=Tim|date=31 August 2007|accessdate=6 September 2010|publisher=Opera Software|work=Opera Desktop Team[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2007/09/opera_95_alpha.html|title=Firefox and more|last=Dotzler|first=Asa|authorlink=Asa Dotzler|date=4 September 2007|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] According to one of Opera's competitors, this is partly because developers do not test web sites with Opera due to its lack of market share, as well as the fact that Opera renders HTML standard compliant code. Because of this issue, Opera 8.01 and higher have included workarounds to help certain popular but problematic web sites display properly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/browserjs/|title=Browser JavaScript Explained|publisher=Opera Software|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/801/|title=Changelog for Opera 8.01 for Windows|publisher=Opera Software|date=16 June 2005|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/mac/801/|title=Changelog for Opera 8.01 for Macintosh|publisher=Opera Software|date=16 June 2005|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/linux/801/|title=Changelog for Opera 8.01 for Linux|publisher=Opera Software|date=16 June 2005|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl]
Notwithstanding other criticism, when Nintendo chose in 2006 to adopt Opera as the web browser for its Wii and Nintendo DS gaming systems, a Nintendo representative explained:
