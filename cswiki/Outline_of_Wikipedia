== What type of thing is Wikipedia? ==

* Reference work – compendium of information, usually of a specific type, compiled in a book for ease of reference. That is, the information is intended to be quickly found when needed. Reference works are usually referred to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts.
** Encyclopedia – compendium holding a summary of information from either all branches of knowledge or a particular branch of knowledge.[tpl]cite web |url=http://library.rcc.edu/riverside/glossaryoflibraryterms.htm#e |title=Encyclopedia. |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070803182506/http://library.rcc.edu/riverside/glossaryoflibraryterms.htm#e |archivedate=2007-08-03[/tpl] Glossary of Library Terms. Riverside City College, Digital Library/Learning Resource Center. Retrieved on: November 17, 2007.
*** Internet encyclopedia project (online encyclopedia) – large database of useful information, accessible via the World Wide Web.
* Website – collection of related web pages containing images, videos or other digital assets. A website is hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local area network through an Internet address known as a Uniform Resource Locator. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
** Wiki – website that allows the creation and editing of any number of interlinked web pages via a web browser using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG text editor.Dictionary.oed.com, Oxford English Dictionary (draft entry, March 2007) Requires Paid Subscription[tpl]Citation|title=wiki|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=1|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|year=2007|location=London|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1192819/wiki|accessdate=2008-04-10[/tpl][tpl]Citation|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc700339.aspx |title=Easy Wiki Hosting, Scott Hanselman's blog, and Snagging Screens |date=July, 2008 |author=Mitchell, Scott |publisher=MSDN Magazine |accessdate=2010-03-09[/tpl] Wikis are typically powered by wiki software and are often developed and used collaboratively by multiple users. Examples include community websites, corporate intranets, knowledge management systems, and note services. The software can also be used for personal notetaking.
* Community – group of interacting people with social cohesion, who may share common values.
** Community of action – community in which participants endeavor collaboratively to bring about change.
** Community of interest – community of people who share a common interest or passion. These people exchange ideas and thoughts about the given passion, but may know (or care) little about each other outside of this area. The common interest on Wikipedia is knowledge.
** Community of purpose – community that serves a functional need, smoothing the path of the member for a limited period surrounding a given activity. For example, researching a topic on Wikipedia.org, buying a car on autobytel.com, or antique collectors on icollector.com or individual.
** Virtual community – social network of individuals who interact through specific media, potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals.
*** Online community – virtual community that exists online and whose members enable its existence through taking part in membership ritual. An online community can take the form of an information system where anyone can post content, such as a Bulletin board system or one where only a restricted number of people can initiate posts, such as Weblogs.
**** Wiki community – users, especially the editors, of a particular wiki.

== Implementation of Wikipedia ==

* Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia – opposing philosophies of editors of Wikipedia concerning the appropriate scope of the encyclopedia, and the appropriate point for a topic to be included as an encyclopedia article or be "deleted".[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/sep2007/sb2007095_137318.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily| title = A Case Study in Online Promotion| author = David E. Gumpert| work = BusinessWeek| date = 2007-09-05| accessdate = 2008-01-23[/tpl]
* List of Wikipedias – Wikipedia is implemented in many languages.  As of July 2011, there were 282 Wikipedias.
* Logo of Wikipedia – unfinished globe constructed from jigsaw pieces—some pieces are still missing at the top—inscribed with glyphs from many different writing systems.
* MediaWiki – free web-based wiki software application developed by the Wikimedia Foundation, that is used to run all of its projects, including Wikipedia. Numerous other wikis around the world also use it to power their websites.
* Notability in English Wikipedia – metric used to determine topics meriting a dedicated encyclopedia article.[tpl]cite web | date=2011-10-18 |author=Wikipedia contributors |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability&oldid=455862975 | title=Wikipedia: Notability | work=Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia | accessdate=2011-10-18[/tpl] It attempts to assess whether a topic has "gained sufficiently significant attention by the world at large and over a period of time" as evidenced by significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the topic.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kathryn Tabb, | url = http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_102864_en.pdf | title = Authority and Authorship in a 21st-Century Encyclopaedia and a ‘Very Mysterious Foundation’ | journal = eSharp | issue = 12: Technology and Humanity | issn = 1742-4542 | publisher = University of Glasgow [/tpl]
* Reliability of Wikipedia – Wikipedia is open to anonymous and collaborative editing, so assessments of its reliability usually include examinations of how quickly false or misleading information is removed. An early study conducted by IBM researchers in 2003—two years following Wikipedia's establishment—found that "vandalism is usually repaired extremely quickly — so quickly that most users will never see its effects"history flow: results IBM Collaborative User Experience Research Group, 2003 and concluded that Wikipedia had "surprisingly effective self-healing capabilities".Fernanda B. Viégas, Martin Wattenberg, Kushal Dave: Studying Cooperation and Conflict between Authors with history flow Visualizations. Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems, 575–582, Vienna 2004,  ISBN 1-58113-702-8
* Vandalism on Wikipedia – the act of editing the project in a malicious manner that is intentionally disruptive. Vandalism includes the addition, removal, or other modification of the text or other material that is either humorous, nonsensical, a hoax, spam or promotion of a subject, or that is of an offensive, humiliating, or otherwise degrading in nature. There are various measures taken by Wikipedia to prevent or reduce the amount of vandalism.
* Wiki magic – described by Jimmy Wales as a phenomenon whereby an author may write the beginnings of an article at the end of the day, only to wake up in the morning and find the stub converted into a much more substantial article.

=== Wikipedia community ===

* Community of Wikipedia – loosely-knit network of volunteers, sometimes known as "Wikipedians", who make contributions to the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. A hierarchy exists whereby certain editors are elected to be given greater editorial control by other community members.
** Volunteering – altruistic activity, intended to promote good or improve human quality of life, but people also volunteer for their own skill development, to meet others, to make contacts for possible employment, to have fun, and a variety of other reasons that could be considered self-serving. Volunteerism is the act of selflessly giving your life to something you believe free of pay. Wikipedia is written entirely by volunteers.
*** Virtual volunteering – working on a task on-line, off-site from the organization being assisted, without the requirement or expectation of being paid, using a computer or other Internet-connected device. Wikipedia is developed on-line by contributors using their web browsers.
**** Micro-volunteering – tasks done by a volunteer, or a team of volunteers, without payment, either online or offline in small increments of time.
** Motivations of Wikipedia contributors – article includes various studies about the motivations of Wikipedia contributors.
** Arbitration Committee (ArbCom) – panel of editors elected by the Wikipedia community that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between editors of the online encyclopedia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/democracy-for-knowalls/2006/11/30/1164777721624.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Know-alls |accessdate=2009-06-15 |last=Schiff |first=Stacy |date=2006-12-02 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Digital Network [/tpl] It acts as the court of last resort for disputes among editors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/technology/internet/08link.html?hpw |title=The Wars of Words on Wikipedia’s Outskirts |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Cohen |first=Noam |date=2009-06-07 |work=The New York Times [/tpl]
** Wikipedia Signpost – on-line community-written and community-edited newspaper, covering stories, events and reports related to Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation sister projects.

== Diffusion of Wikipedia ==

* Diffusion – process by which a new idea or new product is accepted by the market. The rate of diffusion is the speed that the new idea spreads from one consumer to the next.  In economics it is more often named "technological change".
** Diffusion of innovations – process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.
* List of Wikipedias – Wikipedia has spread around the world, being made available to people in their native tongues.  As of July 2011, there were 282 Wikipedias.

== History of Wikipedia ==

* History of Wikipedia – Wikipedia was formally launched on 15 January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, using the concept and technology of a wiki pioneered by Ward Cunningham. Initially, Wikipedia was created to complement Nupedia, an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts, by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it. Wikipedia quickly overtook Nupedia, becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of additional reference projects.
* Nupedia – the predecessor of Wikipedia.  Nupedia was an English-language Web-based encyclopedia that lasted from March 2000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia/|title=The Hive|last=Poe|first=Marshall|publisher=The Atlantic|month=September|year=2006|accessdate=January 1, 2007[/tpl] until September 2003. Its articles were written by experts and licensed as free content. It was founded by Jimmy Wales and underwritten by Bomis, with Larry Sanger as editor-in-chief.
* Wayback Machine – digital time capsule created by the Internet Archive non-profit organization, based in San Francisco, California. The service enables users to see archived versions of web pages (including Wikipedia) across time, which the Archive calls a "three dimensional index". Internet Archive bought the domain waybackmachine.org for their own site. It is currently in its beta test.
** Wikipedia on the Wayback Machine
* Founders of Wikipedia
** Larry Sanger – chief organizer (2001–2002) of Wikipedia. He moved on and founded Citizendium.
** Jimmy Wales – historically cited as a co-founder of Wikipedia, though he has disputed the "co-" designation, declaring himself the sole founder. Wales serves on the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit charitable organization he helped establish to operate Wikipedia, holding its board-appointed "community founder" seat.
* Academic studies about Wikipedia – In recent years there have been numerous academic studies about Wikipedia in peer-reviewed publications. This research can be grouped into two categories. The first analyzed the production and reliability of the encyclopedia content, while the second investigated social aspects, such as usage and administration. Such studies are greatly facilitated by the fact that Wikipedia's database can be downloaded without needing to ask the assistance of the site owner.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1145/1641309.1641326|isbn=978-1-60558-730-1|title=Measuring the wikisphere|first2=James|year=2009|last2=Purtilo|author=Stuckman, Jeff |journal=Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration|pages=1|publisher=WikiSym '09[/tpl]
* Flagged revisions – software extension to the MediaWiki wiki software that allows moderation of edits to Wiki pages. It was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation for use on Wikipedia and similar wikis hosted on its servers. On June 14, 2010, English Wikipedia began a 2-month trial of a similar feature known as pending changes.[tpl]cite news|title="Pending changes" trial to start on June 14|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2010-06-07/News_and_notes|source=Wikipedia Signpost|name=phoebe and HaeB|date=2010-06-07|accessdate=2010-06-13[/tpl] In May 2011, this feature was removed indefinitely from all articles, after a discussion among English Wikipedia editors.[tpl]cite web|title=Wikipedia:Pending changes/Request for Comment February 2011|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Pending_changes/Request_for_Comment_February_2011|work=June 10, 2011|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 1, 2011[/tpl]
