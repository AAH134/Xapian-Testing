The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to applied physics:
Applied physics – physics intended for a particular technological or practical use.[tpl]cite web|title=Applied Physics|url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Applied_physics|work=ArticleWorld|accessdate=10 September 2011[/tpl] 
It is usually considered as a bridge or a connection between "pure" physics and engineering.[tpl]cite web|title=Applied Physics at Caltech - Overview|url=http://www.aph.caltech.edu/overview.html|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=10 September 2011[/tpl]
