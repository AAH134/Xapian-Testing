The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to free software:
Free software â€“ software which can be run, studied, examined, modified, and redistributed. This type of software, which was given its name in 1983, has also come to be known as "open-source software", "software libre",  "FOSS", and "FLOSS". The term "Free" refers to it being unfettered, rather than being free of charge.
