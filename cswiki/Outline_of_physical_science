The following is presented as an overview of and topical guide to physical science:
Physical science â€“ encompasses the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences.  However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena.

== General principles of the physical sciences ==

The foundations of the physical sciences rests upon key concepts and theories, each of which explains and/or models a particular aspect of the behavior of nature.

===Basic principles of physics===

Physics is the "fundamental science" because the other natural sciences (biology, chemistry, geology, etc.) deal with systems that obey the laws of physics.  
The physical laws of matter, energy, and the forces of nature govern the interactions between particles (such as molecules, atoms, or subatomic particles).  Some basic parts of physics are:
*Describing and measuring motion
**Newton's laws of motion
**Forces, weight, and mass
**Momentum and conservation of momentum
*The theory of gravity
*Energy, work, and power
**Motion, position, and energy
*Energy forms
**Energy conservation, conversion, and transfer.
**Energy source the transfer of energy from one source, to work in another.
*Kinetic molecular theory
**Phases of matter and phase transitions
**Temperature and thermometers
**Energy and heat
**Heat flow: conduction, convection, and radiation
**The three laws of thermodynamics
*The principles of waves and sound
*The principles of electricity, magnetism, and electromagnetism
*The principles, sources, and properties of light

===Basic principles of astronomy===

Astronomy is the science of celestial bodies and their interactions in space. Its studies includes the following:
*The life and characteristics of stars and galaxies
*Origins of the universe. Physical science uses the Big Bang theory as the commonly accepted scientific theory of the origin of the universe
*A heliocentric solar system. Ancient and primitive cultures saw the earth as the centre of the solar system or universe ( geocentrism). In the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus advanced the ideas of heliocentrism, recognizing the sun as the centre of the solar system.
*The structure of the solar system, planets, comets, asteroids, and meteors
*The shape and structure of Earth (roughly spherical, see also Spherical Earth)
*Earth in the Solar System
*Time measurement
*The composition and features of the Moon
*Interactions of the Earth and Moon
(Note: Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, which assumes that people's destiny and human affairs in general are correlated to the apparent positions of astronomical objects in the sky -- although the two fields share a common origin, they are quite different; astronomers embrace the scientific method, while astrologers do not.)

===Basic principles of chemistry===

Chemistry, built upon physical concepts, addresses phenomena associated with the structure, composition and energetics of matter and the changes it undergoes. Often known as the central science, chemistry connects the fundamental laws of physics to engineering and other natural sciences such as biology, earth science, astronomy and material science
