The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to physics:
Physics – natural science that involves the study of matter[ref]
Richard Feynman begins his Lectures with the atomic hypothesis, as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ..." 
[/ref] and its motion through spacetime, along with related concepts such as energy and force. More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the cosmos or the philosophical world.

== Nature of physics ==

Physics can be described as all of the following:
* An academic discipline: one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals.
* A scientific field (a branch of science) – widely-recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are several geophysics-related scientific journals.
** A natural science – one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the natural world using empirical and scientific method.
*** A physical science – one that studies non-living systems.
*** A biological science – one that studies the role of physical processes in living organisms. See Outline of biophysics.

== Overview ==

Physics started with a philosophical commitment to simplicity. It should not be considered a difficult subject (although it is deep); one can learn classical physics on a playground, which describes the motion of balls, swings, slides and merry-go-rounds.

* Galileo Galilei - "Father of modern physics.".
* Isaac Newton - Laid the groundwork for classical mechanics, made significant contributions to the field of optics and co-invented the calculus. Often considered the greatest physicist of all time.
* Albert Einstein - Generally considered greatest scientist of the 20th century. Developed both the Special and General Theories of Relativity and proved the existence of atoms beyond doubt.
