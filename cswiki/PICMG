The PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group (PICMG) is a consortium of over 227 companiesRefer to PICMG website metadata and Member Lists. The group, founded in 1994, was originally formed to adapt PCI technology for use in high-performance telecommunications, military and industrial computing applications but its work has now grown to include newer technologies.  
PICMG currently focuses on developing and implementing specifications and guidelines for open standards based computer architectures from a wide variety of interconnects.
On October 25, 2011 PICMG completed of the transfer of assets from the Communications Platforms Trade Association (CP-TA). PICMG will form an xTCA promotional subcommittee to carry on the educational and marketing outreach formerly conducted by members of the CP-TA marketing work group.

==Specification naming convention==

For many years, PICMG used a numerical naming convention with specification being referred to as “PICMG X.YY”.   Where X was used denoted differing form factors (“1” for slot card based single board computers, “2” for CompactPCI and “3” for AdvancedTCA) while YY was used to indicate incremental changes, option definitions or slight variation of a specification form its core specification.  In 2003, PICMG added an acronym-based naming convention for its specifications to yield better results from internet search engines.   Specifications are now often named ABCD.X  where ABCD is an acronym of the specification.   In this naming convention, base or main specification are denote with X=0 (i.e. ABCD.0) and PICMG subsidiary specifications are denoted X>0. PICMG subsidiary specifications represent how various options or variations of a based specification should be handled.
