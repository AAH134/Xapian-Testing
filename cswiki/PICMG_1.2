PICMG 1.2 is a specification by PICMG that standardizes both mechanical and electrical interfaces to support a standard form factor PCI computer system.  PICMG 1.2 defines a single board computer in a passive backplane architecture with either two PCI/PCI-X busses or a single PCI/PCI-X bus.  It is similar to PICMG 1.0 but removes the ISA bus.
