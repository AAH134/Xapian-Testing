PICMG 1.3 is a PICMG specification which is commonly referred to as SHB Express.  SHB Express is a modernization of PICMG 1.0 single board computer specification. SHB Express, or System Host Board â€“ Express, uses the same physical form factor as PICMG 1.0 boards. The board-to-backplane interfaces are PCI Express instead of PCI and ISA, although the use of PCI remains as an option.
