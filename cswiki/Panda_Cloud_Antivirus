Panda Cloud Antivirus is antivirus software by Panda Security; a free and a paid version are available. It is cloud-based in the sense that files are scanned on a remote server without using processing power of the user's machine. The cloud technology is based on Panda's Collective Intelligence."What is Collective Intelligence" It can run constantly, providing protection against viruses and malicious websites but slowing the system to some extent as all such software does, or do a system scan.

==Features==

Panda Security says it detects viruses, Trojans, worms, spyware, dialers, hacking tools, jokes and security risks."What type of threats does the antivirus detect?"
Panda Cloud Antivirus relies on its "Collective Intelligence" and  the cloud for up-to-date information."What is the cloud?" It normally uses an Internet connection to access up-to-date information; if the Internet cannot be accessed it will use a local cache of "the most common threats in circulation"."What happens if my computer is not connected to the Internet?"

==Privacy concerns==

Sending files or even checksums of segments of files out to a remote server to be processed is a severe privacy concern.  The only guarantee of privacy in this case depends on both the goodwill of the company and security at their end.  If Panda's servers are compromised, either by a criminal who works for them or by a hacker, users' security is compromised."Understanding the risks of cloud computing - computer weekly"
However this concern is not only exclusive to cloud-based products. Any antivirus or security product can push out a malicious update by a criminal working at the AV vendor or by a hacker who has compromised the AV update servers.
