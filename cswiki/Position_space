Position space (also real space or coordinate space) denominates the space of possible locations of an object in classical physics.
The real space coordinates specify the position of an object.  For instance,
the trajectory in classical mechanics is described in real space.  The term position space is used in physics in order to make a distinction to:
* Phase space
* Reciprocal space
