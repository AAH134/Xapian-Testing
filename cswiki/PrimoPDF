PrimoPDF is a freeware program that creates a PDF file from Microsoft Windows documents. It works as a virtual printer. It does not present the user with advertisements.[ref]Anne Steyer Phelps, ActivePDF PrimoPDF, PC Today Software Reviews, July 2004 • Vol.2 Issue 7
Page(s) 82 in print issue[/ref] PrimoPDF is developed by the same company that develops the commercial Nitro PDF software.
PrimoPDF requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.  When the program runs, it connects with www.primopdf.com each time it prints.  This can be stopped with a firewall, or by disabling automatic updates within the program settings. It uses the Ghostscript file format converter and RedMon printer redirection software.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.primopdf.com/primopdf.zip | title =PrimoPDF Source Code | year =2010 | publisher =Nitro PDF Pty.
