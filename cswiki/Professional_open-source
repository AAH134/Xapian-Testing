== History ==

As open-source software began to become popular in the 1990s with the introduction of Linux, there was a growing stigma that such a package could not be trusted as stable or supported.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl] As a consequence, larger businesses would often choose commercially distributed software over a product that was released under an open-source license. However, there has been the growth in the number of professional open-source companies - made popular by companies like Liferay, Inc., OpenSearchServer, Red Hat, MySQL AB, and JBoss.  The business model of these companies tries "to offer open-source software with a free license, while using professional services, maintenance and support for these products to derive revenue."[ref]
