Project Kusu is the open source base that was designed from ground up for the basis of Platform Computing's Open Cluster Stack 5.
Project Kusu is built with the objective of being a simplified cluster management, operation and deployment source kit, that supports a range of different linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server, OpenSuSE, and Ubuntu Linux.
In addition, it is also a standards-based, open, and vendor certified modular and hybrid stack that transparently integrates both open source and commercial software under a single consistent cluster operating environment.
