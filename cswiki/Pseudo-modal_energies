The Pseudo-modal energies are the estimation of the energy content of the system near the resonance frequencies. It is appropriately defined as the area near the natural frequencies of the frequency response functions.T. Marwala. "Fault classification using pseudo modal energies and neural networks." American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Journal, 2003, 41(1), pp. 82-89.
