QRpedia is a mobile Web based system which uses QR codes to deliver Wikipedia articles to users, in their preferred language. QR codes can easily be generated to link directly to any Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), but the QRpedia system adds further functionality.
QRpedia was conceived by Roger Bamkin, then chair of Wikimedia UK, coded by Terence Eden, and unveiled in April 2011. It is currently in use at institutions including museums in the United Kingdom, United States and Spain. The project's source code is freely reusable under the MIT License.

== Process ==

When a user scans a QRpedia QR code on their mobile device, the device decodes the QR code into a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) using the domain name "qrwp.org" and whose path (final part) is the title of a Wikipedia article, and sends a request for the article specified in the URL to the QRpedia web server.
The QRpedia server then uses Wikipedia's API to determine whether there is a version of the specified Wikipedia article in the language used by the device, and if so, returns it in a mobile-friendly format. If there is no version of the article available in the preferred language, then the QRpedia server offers a choice of the available languages, or a Google translation.
In this way, one QRcode can deliver the same article in many languages, even when the museum is unable to make its own translations. QRpedia also records usage statistics.

== Implementations ==

Though created in the United Kingdom, QRpedia can be used in any location where the user's phone has a data signal (or with a scanner that remembers URLs until a signal is available) and, as of March 2012, is in use at:
* Children's Chapel, St James' Church, Sydney
* The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, United States
* Derby Museum and Art Gallery, England
* Estonian Sports Museum
* Galleries of Justice Museum
* Fundació Joan Miró, Spain including a travelling exhibit shown at The Tate
* The National Archives, United Kingdom 
* The National Museum of Computing (UK)
* Sofia Zoo, Bulgaria
* The Welsh town of Monmouth, as part of Wikipedia's MonmouthpediA project.
* St Paul's Church, Birmingham
QRpedia also has uses outside of such institutions. For example, the Occupy movement uses it on campaign posters.

== Awards ==

In January 2012, QRpedia was one of four projects (from 79 entrants) declared the most innovative mobile companies in the UK of 2011 by the Smart UK Project, and thus chosen to compete at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, on 29 February 2012.  The criteria were "to be effective, easy to understand and with global potential and impact".
