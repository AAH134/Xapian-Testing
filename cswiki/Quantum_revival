In quantum mechanics, the quantum revival 

is a periodic recurrence of the quantum wave function
from its original form during the time evolution either many times in space as the multiple scaled fractions
in the form of the initial wave function (fractional revival) or approximately or exactly to its original 
form from the beginning (full revival). The quantum wave function periodic in time exhibits therefore the full revival 
every period. The phenomenon of revivals is most readily observable for the wave functions being well localized wave packets at the beginning of the time evolution for example in the hydrogen atom. For Hydrogen the fractional revivals show up 
as multiple Gaussian bumps  around the circle and the full revival as the original Gaussian
.
The full revivals are exact  for infinite quantum well, harmonic oscillator or the hydrogen atom, while for shorter times are approximate 
for hydrogen atom and a lot of quantum systems.
