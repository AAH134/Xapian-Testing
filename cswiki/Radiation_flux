Radiation flux is a measure of the flow of radiation from a given radioactive source.
Φ = L/4πr2 Wm-2 (Watts per meter squared).
Φ is the radiation flux, L is the Luminosity (measured in Watts) and r is the distance from the radiation source.
Radiation flux density is a related measure that adds area dimensions to the above definition.
