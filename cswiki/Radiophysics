Radiophysics is a branch of physics focused on the theoretical and experimental study of certain kinds of radiation: its emission, propagation, and interaction with the medium.
The term is used in the following major meanings: 
*study of radio waves (the original area of research)
*study of radiation used in radiology"Radiophysics" article in Medcyclopaedia, online version of the Encyclopaedia of Medical Imaging
*study of other ranges of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation in some specific applications
Among main applications of radiophysics are radio communications, radiolocation, radioastronomy, and radiology.

==Branches==

*Classical radiophysics deals with radio wave communications and detection
*Quantum radiophysics (physics of lasers and masers; Nikolai Basov was the founder of quantum radiophysics in the Soviet Union)
*Statistical radiophs
