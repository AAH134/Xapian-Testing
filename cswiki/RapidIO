The RapidIO architecture is a high-performance packet-switched, interconnect technology for interconnecting chips on a circuit board, and also circuit boards to each other using a backplane. This technology is designed specifically for embedded systems, primarily for the signal processing, networking, and communications markets.
RapidIO is intended to be the optimal interconnect when clustering networks of peer to peer embedded processors, DSPs, FPGAs and ASICs. RapidIO has found widespread adoption in the following applications:
* Wireless base stations
* Military single-board computers, as well as Radar, Acoustic and Image Processing Systems
* Video 
* Server
* Medical imaging
* Industrial applications
The main competing technology is PCI Express, but PCI Express is targeted at the desktop and high performance computing arenas, as opposed to embedded systems. PCIe does not scale as well in large multiprocessor peer to peer systems as RapidIO as the memory map for PCIe using non transparent bridging is not as simple as RapidIO which uses a push architecture where each endpoint can have its own memory system
RapidIO was developed by Mercury Computer Systems and Motorola (now Freescale Semiconductor), primarily as an upgraded interconnect for Mercury's embedded NUMA/cluster ("multicomputer") signal processing computers.

== Technology ==

The RapidIO specification is a packet-based technology defined for endpoints, which originate and process packets and switches, which are used to connect endpoints. RapidIO is a layered specification, intuitively divided into a physical layer protocol, packet transport (routing) protocol and multiple protocols at the logical layer. Multiple logical layer protocols define different methods by which endpoints can exchange data. The transport layer defines how all RapidIO packets are routed through a RapidIO switch. The physical layer defines the electrical characteristics and link layer packet transfer protocol that all RapidIO endpoints and switches must follow to guarantee interoperability.
There are two incarnations of RapidIO Technology: Parallel RapidIO and Serial RapidIO (SRIO). The main difference between the two is that Parallel RapidIO has a separate clock signal,  while Serial RapidIO uses clock recovery in the receiver to generate a clock from the data stream.  8B/10B encoding is used in the transmitter to ensure DC balance and enough edge density to recover the clock. With respect to actual deployment in both silicon and system level products, Serial RapidIO has had the most traction and is used in all the switches, DSPs, microprocessors and FPGAs widely available on the market today.[tpl]fact|date=November 2009[/tpl]
Packets are big-endian, 256 bytes, with 8-bit or 16-bit addresses, and routed by crossbar switches. Links are point-to-point, with handshaking and reservations to ensure that packets need not be dropped. Links are commonly half-duplex parallel Low voltage differential signaling or serial fiber optic. Special signaling allows timestamps to flood fill through the fabric without concern for packet boundaries. RapidIO is designed to support memory mapping, mailbox queues, and doorbell-style interrupts.
RapidIO serial links can be driven at different baud rates. RapidIO 1.2 and 1.3 support 1.25, 2.5 and 3.125 Gbaud rates.  RapidIO 1.2/1.3 support x1 and x4 link configurations, for a maximum rate of 12.5 Gbaud which equates to a 10 Gbit/s data rate when 8b/10b encoding is removed.  With RapidIO Gen 2, 5 Gbaud and 6.25 Gbaud rates are added.  The RapidIO Gen 2 specifications support x1, x2, x4, x8 and x16 link configurations.   
Standards released by the RapidIO Trade Association include RapidIO 1.2, RapidIO 1.3, RapidIO 2.0. and RapidIO 2.1.  Specifications beyond RapidIO 2.1 are currently in development.

== RapidIO Trade Association ==

Industry leaders in networking, communications, semiconductors, and embedded systems have founded the RapidIO Trade Association to develop and support this international open standard. Ericsson, Freescale Semiconductor, IDT, Texas Instruments, and Xilinx comprise the Steering Committee of the RapidIO Trade Association[tpl]cite web|title= About RapidIO | url = http://www.rapidio.org/about/backgrounder | publisher = RapidIO Trade Association | accessdate=2009-10-07[/tpl].

==Liaisons==

The RapidIO Trade Association has numerous liaisons with other industry groups including the Optical Internetworking Forum, PICMG and the Mountain View Alliance.
