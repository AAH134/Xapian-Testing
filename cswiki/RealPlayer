RealPlayer, by RealNetworks, is a cross-platform software product primarily used for the playing of recorded media. The media player is compatible with numerous formats within the multimedia realm, including MP3, MPEG-4, QuickTime, Windows Media, and multiple versions (proprietary) of RealAudio and RealVideo formats. 
The software is powered by an underlying open source media engine called Helix. The latest current stable release is version RealPlayer SP 1.0. 

==History==

The first version of RealPlayer was introduced in April 1995 as "RealAudio Player" and was one of the first media players capable of streaming media over the Internet. Then, version 4.01 of RealPlayer was included as a selectable Internet tool in Windows 98's installation package. Subsequent versions of the software were titled "RealPlayer G2" (version 6) and "RealOne Player" (version 9), whilst free "Basic" versions as well as paid "Plus" versions, the latter with additional features, have also been offered. For the Windows OS, the RealPlayer version 9 subsumed the features of the separate program, RealJukebox.
RealPlayer 11 was released for Microsoft Windows in November 2007 and for Mac OS X in May 2008. RealPlayer 15 was released November 18, 2011. This version allows users to transfer video, music and photos between their computers and mobile devices, share links of videos and photos on sites such as Facebook and MySpace, and download videos from popular sites such as YouTube and Metacafe.
RealPlayer was a popular streaming media player during the early years of the Internet, but, as of the 21st century, its market share has been surpassed by Windows Media Player and, since mid-2007, by Apple's iTunes.

==Features==

* Support for Bonjour to share Internet favorites.
* Cocoa user interface.

It supports Windows Media 7/8, RealAudio/Video, MP3 and Ogg Vorbis.  The interface depends on the current GTK+ theme.

===RealPlayer for Palm===

It is also compatible with RealPlayer Music Store tracks. However, they will neither install nor run on non-PalmOne-made devices like Sony's Clie line of PDAs. They also do not support modern Palm smartphones such as the treo 700p, 755p, or Centro, although the treo 600 and 650 are listed as supported devices. Their Web page regarding PalmOS support (shown above) gives no indication if support for those devices will ever be provided.

===RealJukebox===

RealJukebox was a computer program released by RealNetworks that allowed users to organise their digital music. It was first released in May 1999. By late 2001 the functions of the program had been integrated into the Real's core media player program, RealPlayer.

==Controversies==

Past versions of RealPlayer have been criticized for containing adware and spyware. In 1999 security researcher Richard M. Smith dissected some of RealJukebox's network traffic and discovered that it was sending a unique identifier with information about the music titles to which its users were listening.  RealNetworks issued a patch, and the spyware was removed in version 1.02. Their download page stated RealJukebox included privacy enhancements and gave a link to the privacy policy.
PC World magazine named RealPlayer (1999 Version) as #2 in its 2006 list The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time, writing that RealPlayer "had a disturbing way of making itself a little too much at home on your PC--installing itself as the default media player, taking liberties with your Windows Registry, popping up annoying 'messages' that were really just advertisements, and so on."  In 2007, it placed RealPlayer, versions 1996-2004, at #5 in its list, The 20 Most Annoying Tech Products.
In 2008 StopBadware.org labeled RealPlayer "badware" for not completely disclosing software components it installs as well as those it leaves behind after being un-installed.
The RealPlayer Message Center has caused controversy due to its pop-up advertisements. In previous versions of the program the Message Center had a reputation for being difficult to turn off completely. In RealPlayer 11 it will not appear unless it is turned on by the user.
When RealPlayer for Windows is installed, a process called tkbell.exe will run automatically each time the computer starts up, and may appear on the list of active processes as realsched.exe.  The process is linked to the Message Center and can also check for updates to the program.  The process is non-essential and is not considered to be harmful, but has been seen as a nuisance by some users.
Earlier Windows versions of RealPlayer experienced a problem with the volume control, where muting the sound in the program would also mute all system sounds.

== Access restrictions ==

Accessing the RealPlayer website and its hosted contents has been banned from countries on the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control sanction list, including Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.

==Real Alternative==

Real Alternative is a software bundle that allows users to play RealMedia files without installing RealPlayer.
Beginning in 2010, RealNetworks sued Hilbrand Edskes, a 26-year old Dutch webmaster for having inserted hyperlinks to Real Alternative on his website www.codecpack.nl. RealNetworks alleges that Real Alternative is a reverse engineered package.
In November 2011 RealNetworks' case against Edskes was dismissed and RealNetworks was ordered to pay him 48,000 Euros in damages.
