== Features ==

Revo Uninstaller runs the selected program's built-in uninstaller, but after the uninstall has completed, it will search and remove files or registry entries that the uninstaller may have left on the user's hard drive.
Revo Uninstaller also cleans out:
* Files in the temporary folder
* Entries in the Windows start-up applications folder
* Browser history and cache of Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera and Netscape
* The recently opened file list in Microsoft Office applications
Revo Uninstaller is also capable of irrecoverably deleting files.
For systems where Revo Uninstaller cannot or should not be installed, a portable version is available that can be started directly from external media, such as a USB drive, without modifying the system.
