The Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach.Robot Framework Homepage
Test cases are persisted in plain text or HTML files and can be edited with any text editor. There is also a graphical development tool, the Robot IDE (RIDE).RIDE Homepage It offers framework-specific features like code completion, syntax highlighting and much more.

== History ==

The basic ideas for the Robot Framework were shaped in the Pekka Kl√§rcks master thesisLaukkanen, Pekka: "Data-Driven and Keyword-Driven Test Automation Frameworks", 2006 in 2005. A first version was developed at Nokia Siemens Networks in the same year. Version 2.0 was released as open source on June 24, 2008.
The framework is written using the Python programming language and has an active community. It is released under Apache License 2.0 and can be downloaded from the project's homepage.

== Add-ons ==

There are many extensions to the Robot Framework, e.g. the SeleniumLibraryRobot Selenium Library for testing web applications.
These libraries are best implemented in Python, but using Java or .Net are also possible.
Other languages such as Perl, Javascript, PHP, etc. can be used for libraries as well, using the remote library interface, see Robot Framework User Guide and documentation for more information.

== Examples ==

The following test case implements a Hello World example:
Log is a built-in keyword that logs the given parameter to the test report generated by the Robot Framework.
With the help of the SeleniumLibrary, writing tests for web applications is very easy too:
This test opens a new browser window and performs an internet search.
