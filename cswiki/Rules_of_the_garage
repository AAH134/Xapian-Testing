The rules of the garage are a set of twelve rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that Bill Hewlett and David Packard when they founded Hewlett-Packard. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of Silicon Valley.

== Etymology ==

The rules were first formulated by Carly Fiorina in 1999 - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign.

== The twelve "Rules of the Garage" ==

The twelve rules are:
* Believe you can change the world.
* Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.
* Know when to work alone and when to work together.
* Share tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.
* No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage).
* The customer defines a job well done.
* Radical ideas are not bad ideas.
* Invent different ways of working.
* Make a contribution every day.
* If it doesn’t contribute, it doesn’t leave the garage.
* Believe that together we can do anything.
* Invent.
