The rules of the garage are a set of twelve rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that Bill Hewlett and David Packard when they founded Hewlett-Packard. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of Silicon Valley.

== Etymology ==

The rules were first formulated by Carly Fiorina in 1999 - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/01/rules-of-the-ga/ |title=Rules of the Garage, And Then Some |work=Wired |first=John C |last=Abell |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2012[/tpl] The name was a reference to David Packard's garage in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded the company after graduating from nearby Stanford University in 1935.[tpl]cite book |title=Bill & Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio |location=New York |first=Michael S |last=Malone |year=2007 |pages=39–41 |isbn=1-59184-152-6[/tpl]

The twelve rules are:
* Believe you can change the world.
* Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.
* Know when to work alone and when to work together.
* Share tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.
* No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage).
* The customer defines a job well done.
* Radical ideas are not bad ideas.
* Invent different ways of working.
* Make a contribution every day.
