In coding theory, the Sardinas–Patterson algorithm is a classical algorithm for determining whether a given variable-length code is uniquely decodable. The algorithm carries out a systematic search for a string which admits two different decompositions into codewords. As Knuth reports, the algorithm was rediscovered about ten years later in 1963 by Floyd, despite the fact that it was at the time already well known in coding theory.Knuth (2003), p. 2

==Idea of the algorithm==

:011101110011 
can be interpreted as the sequence of codewords 
:01110 – 1110 – 011, 
but also as the sequence of codewords 
:011 – 1 – 011 – 10011.
Two possible decodings of this encoded string are thus given by cdb and babe.
