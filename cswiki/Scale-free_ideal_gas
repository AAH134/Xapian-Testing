The scale-free ideal gas (SFIG) is a physical model assuming a collection of non-interacting elements with an stochastic proportional growth. It is the  scale-invariant version of an ideal gas. Some cases of city-population, electoral results and cites to scientific journals can be approximately considered scale-free ideal gases.Fisher-information and the thermodynamics of scale-invariant systems A.

If k is the size of the elements, being k1 and kM the minimum and maximum allowing sizes respectively, and v = dk/dt is the growth, the bulk probability density function F(k, v) of a scale-free ideal gas follows
Zipf's law may emerge in the external limits of the density since it is a special regime of scale-free ideal gases.Zipf’s law from a Fisher variational-principle A. Hernando, D. Puigdomènech, D.
