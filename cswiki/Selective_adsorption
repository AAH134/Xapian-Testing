Selective adsorption is the effect when minima associated with bound-state resonances occur in specular intensity in atom-surface scattering. It was first observed in 1930 by Estermann and Stern. Starting from the 1970s, selective adsorption has been extensively studied, both theoretically and experimentally. It is a powerful tool to determine the gasâ€“surface interaction potential by yielding the vibrational energy spectrum of the gas atom bound to the surface. Energy levels measured with this technique are available for many systems.
