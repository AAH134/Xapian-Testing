The SHS file extension is primarily associated with Shell Scrap Object Files produced by Microsoft Windows.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/138275 They are created by selecting part of a document content and then dragging and dropping it outside the document program window  (e.g. selecting some lines of text in a Word document, dragging and droping them on the desktop). The operating system will create a .shs file with the selected content, which will be useless alone, and only readable by dragging the icon and dropping it in a program which supports this mechanism.http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/shs
