Since the behavior of a given atomic DEVS model can be defined in two different views depending on the total state and the external transition function (refer to Behavior of DEVS), the simulation algorithms are also introduced in two different views as below.

== Common parts ==

Regardless of two different views of total states, algorithms for initialization and internal transition cases are commonly defined as below.
 DEVS-simulator
   variables:
     parent // parent coordinator
         error: bad synchronization;

== View 1: total states = states * elapsed times ==

         error: bad synchronization;

==View 2: total states = states * lifespans * elapsed times==

         error: bad synchronization;
