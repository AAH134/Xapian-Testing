Based on these relationships, the algorithms to simulate the behavior of a given Coupled DEVS are written as follows.

== Algorithms ==

 DEVS-coordinator
   Variables:
      parent // parent coordinator
   when receive init-message(Time ''t'')
   when receive star-message(Time ''t'')
         error: bad synchronization;
         error: bad synchronization;
