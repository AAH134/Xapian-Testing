Sitelinks are hyperlinks to website subpages that appear under certain Google listings in order to help users navigate the site. The site owner cannot add any sitelinks; Google adds them through its own secret automated algorithms. The site owner can, however, block individual sitelinks, which may be useful if he deems them unhelpful.
Search engine optimization experts consider sitelinks to be an important measure of how "trusted" a site is, and accordingly have attempted to deduce what causes them to appear. In an alternative embodiment, it is suggested that web-site providers might provide the search engine system with a list of favoured web-pages within their own web-site.http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2010/0049762.html
Sitelinks with less than 15 characters seem to perform best, according to Google Senior Product Manager Jerry Dischler.
