Skype was released as a simple computer-to-computer, or computer-to-telephone program. Support for paid services such as SkypeOut, SkypeIn, and voice mail allows the company to generate its revenue as well as making local and international telephone calls easier to perform via the user's computer, sometimes cheaper than other companies' rates for similar services.

==History==

Skype was founded in 2003 by Janus Friis from Denmark and Niklas Zennström from Sweden,[tpl]cite web|url=http://about.skype.com/|title=About Skype: What is Skype?|accessdate=28 July 2010[/tpl] having its headquarters in Luxembourg with offices in London, Stockholm, Tallinn, Tartu, Prague,[tpl]cite web | url=http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2006/12/skype_is_expanding_engineering.html | title=Skype is expanding engineering to Prague | first=Jaanus | last=Kase | publisher=Skype Blogs | accessdate=2006-12-05[/tpl] and Palo Alto. The Skype software was developed by Estonians Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallinn, who together with Janus and Niklas were also behind the peer-to-peer file sharing software Kazaa.[tpl]cite web | url=http://emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/article/index.cfm?fuseaction=OpenArticle&aoid=163167&coid=7805&lang=EN | title=Skype — A Baltic Success Story | publisher=credit-suisse.com | accessdate=24 February 2008[/tpl] In April 2003, Skype.com and Skype.net domain names were registered. In August 2003, the first public beta version was released.
One of the initial names for the project was "Sky peer-to-peer", which was then abbreviated to "Skyper". However, some of the domain names associated with "Skyper" were already taken.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.eplanetventures.com/en/news/releases/pr_013006_1.html | title=The World's Hottest VC? [/tpl] Dropping the final "r" left the current title "Skype", for which domain names were available.
In September 2005, SkypeOut was banned in China.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/business/china-bans-skype-911 | title=China bans Skype | author=Jack McCarthy | publisher=InfoWorld | accessdate=7 June 2011[/tpl] In October of the same year, eBay purchased Skype[tpl]cite web | url=http://investor.ebay.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=176402&FYear= | title=eBay Completes Acquisition of Skype | publisher=eBay | accessdate=17 June 2006[/tpl] for $2.6 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/122516/ebay_buys_skype_for_26_billion.html |title=EBay Buys Skype for $2.6 Billion |publisher=PCWorld |date=12 September 2005 |accessdate=11 May 2011[/tpl] (In 2011, the Ars Technica estimated the purchase price at $3.1 billion, not $2.6 billion.)"A Microsoft purchase would not be the first time Skype has been bought out; after being started in 2003, it was bought by eBay in 2005 for $3.1 billion. eBay then sold the majority of its stake in 2009 to a private investment group for $1.2 billion less than it paid." http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/05/wsj-microsoft-to-buy-skype-for-7bn-rest-of-world-for-real.ars In December 2005, videotelephony was introduced.[tpl]cite web | url=http://about.skype.com/2005/12/skype_launches_next_generation.html | title=Skype Launches Next Generation Free Internet and Video Calling for Everyone | publisher=Skype | accessdate=17 June 2006[/tpl]
In April 2006, the number of registered users reached 100 million. In October, Skype 2.0 for Mac was released, the first full release of Skype with video for Macintosh, and in December, Skype announced a new pricing structure, with connection fees for all SkypeOut calls. Skype 3.0 for Windows was released.
In 2006, a now-discontinued feature called "Skypecasting" was introduced. It allowed recordings of Skype voice over IP voice calls and teleconferences to be used as podcasts. Skypecasting remained in beta until it was discontinued. Skypecasts hosted public conference calls for up to 100 people at a time. Unlike ordinary Skype p2p conference calls, Skypecasts supported moderation features suitable for panel discussions, lectures, and town hall forums. Skype operated a directory of public Skypecasts. Skypecasts was discontinued from 1 September 2008.[tpl]cite web | url = http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2008/08/goodnight_skypecasts.html | title=Goodnight Skypecasts — Skype Blogs |publisher=Share.skype.com |date=August 2008 | accessdate=31 March 2009[/tpl]
Throughout 2007, updates (3.1, 3.2 and 3.5) added new features including Skype Find, Skype Prime, Send Money (which allowed users to send money via PayPal from one Skype user to another), video in mood, inclusion of video content in chat, call transfer to another person or a group, and auto-redial. Skype 2.7.0.49 (beta) for Mac OS X released adding availability of contacts in the Mac Address Book to the Skype contact list, auto redial, contact groups, public chat creation, and an in-window volume slider in the call window.

By early 2008, the tumultuous ownership relations between the founders and eBay had resulted in significant leadership churn, with a succession of Skype presidents including Niklas Zennström, Rajiv Dutta, Alex Kazim, Niklas Zennström (again), and Henry Gomez, all holding that title at various points between 2005 and 2007. The business had failed to meet certain earn-out targets, growth was decelerating, product development had slowed significantly, and in October 2007 eBay took a $1.4 billion 'impairment' on the value of Skype, admitting it had overpaid, and now valuing the company at about $2.7 billion.[tpl]cite web | url = http://corporatetool.blogspot.com/2007/10/ebays-skype-writedown.html/ | title = ebays-skype-writedown | date=2 October 2007 | accessdate=2 October 2007 [/tpl]

===Two original founders depart and new CEO appointed===

For the six months after the departure of Niklas and Janus, Michael van Swaaij led the company as Interim CEO, until the appointment of Josh Silverman in February 2008.[tpl]cite web | url =http://about.skype.com/2008/02/ebay_inc_appoints_new_ceos_of.html/ | title = eBay Inc. Appoints New CEOs of Skype and Shopping.com | date=25 February 2008 | accessdate=25 February 2008 [/tpl] Silverman was "widely viewed as bringing in stability to Skype after a tumultuous phase that followed the exit of the two Skype co-founders."[tpl]cite web | url =http://gigaom.com/2010/10/07/ex-skype-ceo-josh-silverman-joins-greylock-as-eir/ | title = Ex-Skype CEO Josh Silverman Joins Greylock as EIR | date=7 October 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2010[/tpl] Under Silverman's 2.5 year tenure, the company focused its product efforts around video calling, ubiquity (gaining high penetration on smartphones, PCs, TVs, and consumer-electronic devices), building tailored offerings for enterprise customers, and diversifying revenue through subscriptions, premium accounts and advertising.
In advancing this strategy, Skype released many new products, substantially revamping its flagship Windows software (3.8 ->4.0), and its Macintosh and Linux software; while introducing new software products for smartphones, and consumer electronics. In 2009, Skype 4.0 was released, featuring full-screen high-quality video calling.[tpl]cite news|author=Last Updated: 2:39PM GMT 6 February 2009 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/technologynews/4525013/New-Skype-4.0-software-adds-full-screen-video-calls.html |title=New Skype 4.0 software adds full-screen video calls |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009 | location=London[/tpl] the Linux client was updated, and an iPhone application was launched which topped the charts with over 1M downloads in its first two days.[tpl]cite web | url =http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/02/skype-iphone-app-downloaded-one-million-times-in-first-two-days/ | title = Skype for iPhone tops 1M downloads in two days | date=3 April 2009 | accessdate=3 April 2009 [/tpl] Skype also announced the launch of its software for the Android platform.[tpl]cite web | url =http://about.skype.com/2009/01/skype_launches_on_android_plat.html/ | title = Skype Launches on Android Platform and more than 100 Java-Enabled Mobile Phones | date=8 January 2009| accessdate=8 January 2009 [/tpl] Rounding out its ubiquity push, in 2010 Skype announced deep integration of Skype software into the IP-connected TVs from Panasonic, Samsung and Sony.[tpl]cite web | url =http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/01/skype_on_your_tv.html/ | title = Get Skype on your TV | date=5 January 2010 | accessdate=5 January 2010 [/tpl]
During this period Skype also discontinued lesser-used services such as support for the "Skype Me" presence indicator, which meant that a user was interested in receiving Skype calls from a non-contact. Skype also discontinued its SkypeCast service without explanation and added internal monthly and daily usage caps on their SkypeOut subscriptions, which had been advertised as "unlimited". Skype also discontinued its "dragonfly" feature, a community-generated yellow-pages product, and other features which were deemed to be under-performing or a distraction to management. Many users and observers had commented on the high rate of dropped calls and the difficulty reconnecting dropped calls. Updates including versions for the Sony PSP hand-held gaming system, version 2.0 for Linux with support for video-conferencing.
As part of its efforts to diversify revenues, Skype launched in April 2008 Skype for SIP, a service aimed at business users. At that time around 35 per cent of Skype's users were business users.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123776338990608661.html|title=Skype Targets Businesses to Ring Up New Revenue|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|last=Fowler|first=Geoffrey A.|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=23 March 2009|postscript=[/tpl] In targeted premium products to consumers, Skype launched new monthly premium subscriptions products in May 2010.[tpl]cite web | url =http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2010/05/05/skype-to-launch-monthly-subscriptions-and-group-video-chat/ | title = Skype to launch monthly subscriptions and group video chat | date=5 May 2010 | accessdate=5 May 2010 [/tpl]
Marketing efforts were also re-vamped, with a particular focus on innovative partnerships with TV broadcasters to integrate Skype into their programming. The Oprah Winfrey Show began using Skype regularly to host video calls between Oprah and her viewers at home, culminating in a show dedicated exclusively to the wonders of Skype ("where the Skype are You", aired first in May 2009).[tpl]cite news | url =http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/05/21/skype-gets-the-oprah-treatment/ | title = Skype Gets the Oprah Treatment | date=21 May 2009 | accessdate=21 May 2009 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Geoffrey A. | last=Fowler[/tpl] Skype also became commonly used by network news stations around the world, as a cost-effective replacement for sending satellite trucks, and enabling fast response from citizen journalists. Skype was also integrated into scripted TV programming, such as Californication; and in the seventh season of the U.S. syndicated version of the British game show Who Wants To Be a Millionaire in a new Ask the Expert video chat lifeline.
These efforts led to dramatically accelerating growth of Skype's Connected Users and Paying Users in 2008 and 2009.[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-skype-is-a-real-live-growth-company-2010-8/ | title = Skype is a real live growth company | date=9 August 2010| accessdate=9 August 2010[/tpl] By 2009 Skype was adding about 380,000 new users each day;[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/159279/skype_growing_by_380000_users_a_day.html/ | title = Skype Growing by 380,000 Users a Day | date=10 February 2009 | accessdate=10 February 2009[/tpl] and by 2010, Telegeography estimated that Skype accounted for 25 per cent of the world's international calling minutes. According to their research, the overall international calling market grew a tepid 5 to 6 per cent annually in 2010. "Skype, however, has seen a huge uptick in growth, particularly in the last two years."[tpl]cite web | url =http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/report_finds_skype_now_accounts_for_about_25_of_in.php/ | title = Report Finds Skype Now Accounts for About 25% of International Call Minutes | date=6 January 2011 | accessdate=6 January 2011 [/tpl]

==Legal issues==

=== P2P licensing dispute lawsuit and IPO offering ===

In its 2008 Annual Report, eBay admitted to an on-going dispute between it and Joltid Ltd. over the licensing of its peer-to-peer "Global Index" technology in its application. It announced that it terminated a standstill agreement, allowing either company to sue. On 1 April 2009, eBay filed with a UK court to settle the legal dispute. A few days later, eBay announced the planning of a public stock offering in 2010 to spin off Skype as a separate, publicly-owned company. Some media outlets characterized the proposed sale and ongoing provision of Skype as being under threat because of the concurrent dispute.
On 1 September 2009, a group of investors led by Silver Lake bought 65% of Skype for $1.91 billion. This prompted Joltid to countersue eBay on 17 September 2009.[ref]

Critics of such policies argue that it is wrong for companies to profit from censorship and restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Human rights advocates such as Human Rights Watch and media groups such as Reporters Without Borders speculate that if companies stopped contributing to the authorities' censorship efforts, the government could be forced to change.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/20/skype_china_censorship_row | title=Skype uses peer-pressure defense to explain China text censorship | publisher=The Register | accessdate=2006-06-18[/tpl]
Niklas Zennström, then chief executive of Skype, told reporters that its joint venture partner in China was operated in compliance with domestic law. "TOM Online had implemented a text filter, which is what everyone else in that market is doing," said Mr Zennström. "Those are the regulations," he said. "I may like or not like the laws and regulations to operate businesses in the UK or Germany or the US, but if I do business there I choose to comply with those laws and regulations. I can try to lobby to change them, but I need to comply with them. China in that way is not different."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/875630d4-cef9-11da-925d-0000779e2340.html | title=Skype says texts are censored by China | publisher=Financial Times | work=FT.com |date=April 18, 2006[/tpl]

The exact reasons for the decision were not given.
