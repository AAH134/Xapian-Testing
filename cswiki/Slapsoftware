The Slapsoftware, or Software Livre da Administração Processual ("Free Software of the Procedural Management"), is a Brazilian open source system, developed by a staff to be used in the automation of judicial, administrative and legislative procedures of the Public power. It's registered in INPI (National Industrial Propriety Institute). The applications of procedural automation or management are those that deal with a core activity related to the public management, more specifically to the procedures (sets of acts with a purpose), systems with features of research, control, follow-up and storing of data, beyond other ones. That applications are known by various names, like judicial automation, digital procedure, electronic process of law or even protocol.

== Purposes ==

The project Slapsoftware was created with the main purpose of economy to public treasure by the reuse of modules in the systems of the various Public Departments, Public powers and scopes of the Public Management.
It intends too to eliminate the institutional wasting with successive installations of new systems because of fails caused by different ethiologies. Finally, to set into this theme's community a set of knowledge items in the scope of the interdisciplinarity between law and IT.

== Concepts ==

The Slapsoftware starts, as basic principle, with the idea of generalization. This appears in conceiving that there is a root principiology in which concerns his concept in information systems, agrouping three big subsets (judicial, administrative and legisative), as the most granularized divisions (civil, criminal), their applications in various environments (instance of jurisdiction, departments, special courts) and, finally, the kind of materializing documents (paper or electronics).
Beyond, the modularization and reuse appear as fundamental concepts, related to necessity of adapting and communication between different systems in a country of continental size. Its core is founded in IT conceptions of object-orientation, component-orientatation and parametrized system. The idea of open source or free software, mixed with the wiki paradigm, are detached in the concepts of Slapsoftware because it starts from the premise of this type of development as a nowadays reality in all other areas of IT application.

== Modules ==

The Slapsoftware,Slapsoftware talking about formal elements, has a case, example applications, documentations UML and handbooks directed to all the spectrum of its public.

== Interation with community ==

The Slapsoftware interacts with the general midia, as well as the different social networksTwitter and other available tools in the world wide web.Yahoo GruposSourceforge

== History ==

It started in January 2008 and thereby studied by interested student,  executive and staff members, in the way of becoming institutional to achieve the public economy.
