First music is broken into blocks of a few seconds or shorter.  Then  music editors determine which blocks flow smoothly into or out of other blocks.  They also mark blocks as appropriate beginning or ending pieces.  This process can take several hours for a piece of music that is a few minutes in length.  Finally special software uses the information encoded into each block to create a score of any length with a musical beginning and end.
There are many non-linear editing systems that can use SmartSound music to create custom length scores. Notable video editing software includes Adobe Premiere Elements, Corel VideoStudio, CyberLink Media Suite, Pinnacle Studio version 1 through 12, PowerDirector, Ulead MediaStudio Pro and many Roxio software products.  
Software plug-ins are available for Final Cut Pro and Pinnacle Studio 15. SmartSound's soundtrack creation software, Sonicfire Pro, is available directly from SmartSound.  There is both a free and full version. The full version is also bundled with Media Composer, Roxio Creator 2011 Pro, and Xpress Pro.
Vimeo added SmartSound as a partner in May 2012 to let users create customized soundtracks for their videos by controlling the length, musical arrangement, and instrument mix from a base of nearly 4,000 songs. SmartSound music is available now from the Vimeo Music Store, priced at $1.99 a track for personal use license and $19.99 per track for a commercial license.http://s.tt/1d52t, PR Newswire
