Solve for X is a think tank project launched by Google to incite collaboration to solve global issues, "X" representing a remedy.
Solve for X has been likened to TED talks since both projects host seminars by innovators, which can be viewed by others "vicariously" through the projects' respective websites. European director Bruno Giussani stated regarding Google's endeavor: "The world needs more ideas, not fewer and more commitment to sharing them freely and openly so that collectively we can test-run them and turn them into reality ... Google being at the origin of this, obviously technology and engineering will play a big role in Solve For X".
Solve for X was initially believed to be linked to the Google X Lab working on new technology such as web-connected appliances, driverless cars, and space elevators, but eWeek reported that Google X is wed to more realistic undertakings, not the "moonshot" solutions Solve for X was created to pursue.
