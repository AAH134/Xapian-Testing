SoundApp is a freeware audio player for the Macintosh operating system.  It was among the earliest MP3 players for the Classic Mac OS, and was widely praised for its ability to play back, and convert between, a variety of audio file formats.
The program appears to have been abandoned by its creator, Norman Franke, after the release of SoundApp 2.7.3.  Franke's reasons for abandoning the project have never been made public, and SoundApp has never been ported to Mac OS X.
Another developer has begun a version for Mac OS X, "SoundApp Reborn",SoundApp Reborn but this project does not use any of Franke's original code.
