Spectroradiometers are instruments designed to measure the spectral power distributions of illuminants. They operate almost like spectrophotometers in the visible region. They are commonly used to evaluate and categorize lighting for sales by the manufacturer, or for the customers to confirm the lamp they decided to purchase is within their specifications. 
Spectroradiometers are frequently used to calibrate LCD and CRT displays such as on laptops and HDTVs. CIE color values are measured and compared to predefined values, to ensure that the color displayed is correct, thus removing color variance between multiple displays.[tpl]clear[/tpl]
