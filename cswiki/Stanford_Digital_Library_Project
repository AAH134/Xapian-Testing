The primary goal of the SDLP project was to "provide an infrastructure that affords interoperability among heterogeneous, autonomous digital library services." and described elsewhere as "to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and "universal" library, proving uniform access to the large number of emerging networked information sources and collections."The Stanford Integrated Digital Library Project, Award Abstract #9411306, September 1, 1994 through August 31, 1999 (Estimated), award amount $4,516,573.
The SDLP is notable in the history of Google as a primary sources of funding for Lawrence Page's and Sergey Brin (Brin was also supported by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship) during the period they developed the precursors and initial versions of the Google search engine prior to the incorporation of Google as a private entity.  It was also while at Stanford working under the SDLP that Lawrence Page filed his patent for PageRank.[ref]Patent Number: 6285999
