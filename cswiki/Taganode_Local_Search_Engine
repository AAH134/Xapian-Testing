The Open Local Search Engine from Taganode is a search engine specifically targeting mobile phones. It is based on local search algorithms to find new places of interest within a specified distance.
The Taganode search engine offers an Open Developer API that any one can use freely when writing new applications for iPhones, Android phones and other platforms.
The search engine is optimized for mobile phones by low bandwidth usage and only makes the simplest service calls to try to be compatible with as many mobile phones as possible. The Taganode search service is at this moment present in London, Rome, Venice, Amsterdam, Berlin, Sweden and in Denmark.
