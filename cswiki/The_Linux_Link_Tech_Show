== About the Show ==

The Linux Link Tech Show Linux is one of the longest running Linux podcasts in the world.http://www.tllts.org/about.php It was originally started by Lehigh Valley Linux User Group members Dann Washko and Linc Fessenden in September 2003. Allan Metzler, “the guy that brought the equipment” soon joined the show as a regular host in October of that year. In early 2005, Patrick Davila, a member of their LUG joined the show as a permanent host, completing the current Tech Show lineup. Initially, their goal was to simply provide “a weekly *live* webcasted radio style show about Linux and Technology” http://www.tllts.org, but they have since expanded out into Podcasting. In fact, they were one of the very early adopters, and their very own Linc Fessenden wrote BashPodder, being unhappy with the current state of Linux podcast clients at the time.
The Linux Link Tech Show is broadcast live on the internet every Wednesday at 8:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. Podcasts are made available shortly after under a Creative Commons license. As of November 1 2011, TLLTS has produced over 426 episodes.
In March 2009 it was announced several new guest hosts would be joining the show on a weekly rotating basis. The initial guest hosts include Chess Griffin, Dave Yates, Chad Wollenberg, Joel "Gorkon" Mclaughlin and Justin "threethirty" O'Brien.
The 365th show was recorded/broadcast on Wednesday the 4th of August 2010, when the hosts decided it was time to throw in the towel on their "1st season". The "2nd season" will kick off the weekend of Sept. 11 during Ohio Linux Fest.
