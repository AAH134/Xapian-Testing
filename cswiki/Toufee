Toufee is flash movie creating/editing software that is distributed online. It is an online software which runs inside the browser, so it is compatible with Windows, GNU/Linux and Macintosh operating systems. It contains features such as text effects, image transitions, audio/video support, and timeline editing.

==Layout==

Toufeeâ€™s layout is similar to Microsoft Powerpoint. At the top there is menu bar. Beneath the menu bar there are two columns. The column of frames on the left is the "filmstrip". The bigger column, on the right, is the "stage". 
The stage is similar to a big painting canvas where users add text, photos, videos, etc. The filmstrip is a panorama of the stage (allowing the preview of different frames).

==Making flash movies ==

To create flash movies in Toufee one does not require knowledge of programming, or Actionscript. It is instead a straightforward process, allowing anyone to create movies with ease. Frames, text, images, videos, notes, sounds and buttons can be added to the movies by clicking the buttons on the menu bar. Double-clicking on any item opens a properties window for the selected item. This can be used to change the appearance of the selected item, add sounds effects, change timing, and so on. 
The finished movie can be published online as an SWF file. It can only be viewed online, however, unless converted to a video file format with a third-party utility.

==Editing, effects and transitions==

There are over 50 text effects, and 25 image transitions. These are applied using a drag and drop interface from the "effects" or "transitions" folders. Sound clips, and masks, can be added to any items on the stage by dragging those effects onto the items.
