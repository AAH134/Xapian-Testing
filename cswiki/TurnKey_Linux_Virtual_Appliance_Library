The Turnkey Linux Virtual Appliance Library is an open source project developing a free virtual appliance library of pre-packaged servers based on Ubuntu that can be deployed on virtual machines, in cloud computing infrastructures or installed in physical computers.

== Features ==

Each virtual appliance is a ready-to-use solution that's optimized for ease of use in server-type usage scenarios. Each appliance is designed to "just work" with little to no configuration required.
The project currently maintains over 40 virtual appliances, which are packaged in multiple build formats:
# Amazon Machine Image: provisioned on-demand via the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud.
# Virtual appliance: a ready-to-run Virtual Machine with optimized builds available for  OpenStack, OVF, OpenVZ and Xen. Does not require installation. TKL OVZ appliances are also available in Proxmox VE with direct download from within the PVE WebUI (via TKL mod for PVE v1.x 
# Installable Live CD: an ISO image which installs on both bare metal (I.e., a non-virtualized physical machine) and virtual machines, including VMware, Xen, VirtualBox, and KVM. This image can also run live in non-persistent demo mode.
Pre-integrated server applications include LAMP, Joomla, Drupal, WordPress, MySQL, MediaWiki, Domain controller, File server, Ruby on Rails, phpBB, and many others.

== History ==

Founded by engineers of an Israeli startup,
The project launched in September 2008 with three prototype appliances for Drupal, Joomla and LAMP, based on the Ubuntu 8.04.1 build. 
In October 2009, the project released 40 appliances based on Ubuntu 8.04.3 including 25 new additions to the virtual appliance library. The release included support for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and a new Virtual Machine image format with OVF support.
TurnKey Linux was listed as a winner of the 2009 "Bossies" by InfoWorld as one of the "Top 40 open source products" of that year.2009 BOSSie for Open Source Platforms and Middleware, see Slide 7
Turnkey Linux was nominated for the SourceForge February 2012 Project of the Month

== Design ==

TurnKey's virtual appliances are a series of "stripped down" versions of Ubuntu. To this they add the TurnKey Core, which includes all the common features for the project's virtual appliances, including:
* di-live: a live installer, derived from debian-installer.
* A configuration console: developed in Python for the project to allow users to perform basic configuration tasks (for example, networking configuration, reboots)
* An automatic mechanism that installs security patches on a daily basis.
* Web administration interface based on Webmin which includes a selection of generic add-on control and configuration modules.
The TurnKey Core has a footprint of approximately 110 MB, and is available as a separate download. Application software is installed on top of the Core, which typically increases the size of a virtual appliance up to approximately 160 MB. By downloading and installing the appliance package to the hard drive, it is intended by the developers that administrators would gain an easy method of setting up a dedicated server.
TurnKey's virtual appliances can be customized and extended using TKLPatch,TKLPatch - a simple appliance customization mechanism a simple appliance modification mechanism. New virtual appliances can be built as high-level patches to the closest starting point in the library.
TurnKey Linux is designed to run as a virtual machine with VirtualBox and VMWare, although the former has been described as having been provided with more documentation.
