Tux is a penguin character and the official mascot of the Linux kernel.Linux Logos and Mascots Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles. In video games featuring the character, female counterparts, named Penny and Gown, accompany him. The character is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux.

==Origins==

The concept of the Linux mascot being a penguin came from Linus Torvalds, the creator of  Linux. Tux was created by Larry Ewing in 1996 after an initial suggestion made by Alan CoxRe: Linux logo and further refined by Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list.Re: Linux Logo prototype Torvalds took his inspiration from a photographThe photo that inspired Linus Torvalds he found on an FTP site,Re: Linux logo showing a penguin figurine looking strangely like the Creature Comforts characters made by Nick Park. The first person to call the penguin "Tux" was James Hughes, who said that it stood for "(T)orvalds (U)ni(X)".Re: Let's name the penguin! (was: Re: Linux 2.0 really _is_ released..) However, tux is also an abbreviation of tuxedo, the outfit which springs to mind when one sees a penguin.
Tux was originally designed as a submission for a Linux logo contest. Three such competitions took place; Tux won none of them. This is why Tux is formally known as the Linux mascot and not the logo.The History of Tux the Linux Penguin Tux was created[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/notes.html|title=Notes on creation|author=Larry Ewing|accessdate=2007-07-31[/tpl] by Larry Ewing using the first publicly released[tpl]cite book |last= Bunks |first=Carey |title= Grokking the GIMP |year=2000 |publisher= New Riders |isbn=0-7357-0924-6 |url=http://gug.sunsite.dk/docs/Grokking-the-GIMP-v1.0/node14.html [/tpl] version (0.54) of GIMP, a free software graphics package.

According to Jeff Ayers, Linus Torvalds had a "fixation for flightless, fat waterfowl" and Torvalds claims to have contracted "penguinitis" after being gently nibbled by a penguin: "Penguinitis makes you stay awake at nights just thinking about penguins and feeling great love towards them." Torvalds' supposed illness is a joke, but he really was bitten by a Little Penguin on a visit to the National Zoo & Aquarium, Canberra, Australia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linux.org.au/linux/tux|title="Tux" the Aussie Penguin|publisher=Linux Australia|accessdate=2006-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060507115127/http://www.linux.org.au/linux/tux  |archivedate = 2006-05-07[/tpl] Torvalds was looking for something fun and sympathetic to associate with Linux, and a slightly fat penguin sitting down after having had a great meal perfectly fit the bill.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linux.org/info/penguin.html|title=Why a Penguin?|publisher=Linux Online|accessdate=2009-05-19 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100815081131/http://www.linux.org/info/penguin.html |archivedate= 2010, 08, 15[/tpl]

==Uses==

In some Linux distributions, Tux greets the user during booting, with multi-processor systems displaying multiple images of Tux, one for each processor-core. Tux appeared as a character during one arc in the webcomic User Friendly. TUX is the name of a Linux-based web server.
In 1999, Corel Linux Deluxe included a free Linux Penguin (Tux).Corel Linux OS Deluxe, Corel Corporation, 1999.

===Video games===

Tux has taken on a role in the Linux community similar to that which Mario holds in the Nintendo community. He has been featured in open-source look-alikes of other mainstream games, such as Tux Racer, Extreme Tux Racer, Tux Math Scrabble, TuxWordSmith Tux Math, SuperTux, SuperTuxKart, and Tux Paint. As such, several computer games, mostly free and open source and/or for Linux, have included Tux, including:
* Age of Empires III: A real-time strategy game produced by Microsoft. One of the random names which is assigned to explorer's dogs is 'Tux the Conqueror'.http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~yueyue/shipname2.htm - Age of Empires III dog names list (In Japanese)
* OpenArena: contains a character named "Penguin," who is a man dressed in a costume resembling Tux.
* Pingus: A Lemmings clone in which the lemmings are replaced by penguins in reference to Tux.
* SuperTux: a platform game inspired by Super Mario Bros.
* Tux Kart and SuperTuxKart: Kart racing games similar to the Mario Kart series.
* Tux Math Scrabble: Math version of the popular family game starring Tux.
* TuxWordSmith: Scrabble in over 80 languages starring Tux.
* Tux Paint: A drawing program for young children, most likely inspired by Kid Pix.
* Tux, of Math Command: a free software math tutoring arcade game.
* Tux Typing: a free software educational game designed to teach typing.
* Tux Racer: A game similar to snowboarding video games, in which the player controls Tux sliding downhill on his belly rather than humans snowboarding down a track.
* FreeCiv: A Civilization-like game; the leader name of the Antarctican civilization is "Tux". In addition, the Colossus is an enormous Tux statue, depending on the tile set selected.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
* WarMUX: A turn-based strategy game inspired by Worms, featuring many free and open source software mascots, including Tux.
* Frozen Bubble: A free software puzzle game, featuring Tux-esque penguins.
* LinCity-NG: A free software strategy game that allows you to build a Tux statue.

====Female Tux versions in video games====

Some games that star Tux also include explicitly female penguin characters, allowing the players to play as one of those characters instead of Tux. One such female penguin is Tux's friend "Gown". Gown is variously depicted as being a pink version of Tux (XTux) or as having a somewhat less fat appearance and wearing items of clothing such as a red and white short skirt and a hair bow (e.g. TuxKart and A Quest for Herring). In SuperTux and SuperTuxKart, there is a different female penguin called "Penny" who is purple and white (SuperTuxKart once had Gown and still has a map called "Gown's Bow"). In the upcoming Tux 2 there is supposed to be a female penguin called "Trixi", and in FreeCiv the female leader name for the Antarctican civilization is "Tuxette".

===Tux in popular culture===

===Other uses===

* Tux had an uncredited use in the Al Gore's Penguin Army video.
* During the Q&A session following his COMDEX Fall 1999 keynote address, Linus Torvalds was asked if he had any idea how many stuffed penguins had been sent to Bill Gates. Torvalds's response was another question: "To the nearest thousand?".
* There is a Pet (creature who will fight alongside your character) in the online game DragonFable that is a penguin named "Linus". Along with the tagline on the pet, he is shown to be a version of Tux.
* Tux has been adapted to a designer toy called a Gwin and is distributed by October Toys. It is redesigned by different artists and sold in short collectible runs through the October Toys website and other collectable vinyl toy sites.

[/ref] have noted that Tux bears a striking resemblance with a cake template on the front cover of the Australian Women's Weekly "Party Animals", a cake recipe book published by ACP Magazines. The design is titled "The Penguin Prince" and no credit is given. ACP later acknowledged the similarity and added they lost track of the original template designer.http://davehall.com.au/blog/dave/2007/08/02/tux-cake#comment-216
* It's possible to make Tux talk using the cowsay command in Unix or Ubuntu (after installing fortune-mod and cowsay) by adding the option -f tux to it. In the following example the text in the cowsay is piped from the fortune command:
 user@myhost:~$ fortune | cowsay -f tux

==Tuz==

Tuz was the mascot of the 2009 linux.conf.au conference. It has been chosen by Linus Torvalds as the logo for version 2.6.29 of the Linux kernelLinus' git commit from Rusty Russell to support the effort to save the Tasmanian devil species from extinctionLWN.net: The kernel gets a new logo due to the devil facial tumour disease.
The image was designed by Andrew McGown and recreated as an Inkscape SVGhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tuz-logo.svg by Josh Bush,http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/open-sauce/22491-one-bush-who-has-designs-on-lca2009?start=1 and released under Creative Commons license CC-BY-SA.file Documentation/logo.txt from Linux kernel source code
