Tux Droid is a Linux wireless Tux mascot (210mm x 180mm x 140mm - with lowered wings) with a programmable interface, allowing it to announce events by its gestures and by ALSA driven sound. The events are detected by specific gadgets, which are handled by the Tux Gadget Manager. The Tux Droid supports Linux kernel 2.4 or later and needs a 800 MHz CPU and 128 MB RAM. It communicates by infrared to the USB port (1.1 or 2.0) and for media detection it needs an internet connection. The mascot is driven by Atmel AVR RISC microcontrollers.
The new version supports also Windows-based PCs. The Tux Droid can be used with Windows XP and Windows Vista (both at 32 Bit).

== Features ==

The mascot comes with a microphone and an infrared receiver, to perform a 2.4 GHz wireless full-duplex digital link between the USB dongle. The Tux Droid also has a light sensor and a push button on top of the head. Its gestures cover e.g. eye- and wing-movements, while switch sensors in both wings are triggered by pushing the wings. For its sound output there is a volume control wheel to control a speaker and a 3.5mm stereo audio socket for audio out.
The software, which comes with the mascot, so far combines just some primary gadgets (some more are under development, such as a Skype and an AI ALICE chat robot).
