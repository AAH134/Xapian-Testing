The Yager's OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators[tpl]cite journal|last=Yager|first=R.R|title=On ordered weighted averaging aggregation operators in multi-criteria decision making|journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics|year=1988|volume=18|pages=183–190[/tpl]  have been widely used to aggregate the crisp values in decision making schemes (such as multi-criteria decision making, multi-expert decisin making, multi-criteria multi-expert decision making)[tpl]cite book|last=Yager|first=R. R. and Kacprzyk, J|title=The Ordered Weighted Averaging Operators: Theory and Applications|year=1997|publisher=Kluwer: Norwell, MA[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Yager|first=R.R, Kacprzyk, J. and Beliakov, G|title=Recent Developments in the Ordered Weighted Averaging Operators-Theory and Practice|year=2011|publisher=Springer[/tpl]. It is widely accepted that fuzzy sets[tpl]cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=L.A|title=Fuzzy sets|journal=Information and Control |year=1965|volume=8 |pages=338–353|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X[/tpl] are more suitable for representing preferences of criteria in decision making. But fuzzy sets are not crisp values, how can we aggregate fuzzy sets in OWA mechanism? 
The type-1 OWA operators[tpl]cite journal|last=Zhou|first=S. M.|coauthors=F. Chiclana, R. I. John and J. M. Garibaldi|title=Type-1 OWA operators for aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights induced by type-2 linguistic quantifiers|journal=Fuzzy Sets and Systems|year=2008|volume=159|issue=24|pages=3281–3296|doi=10.1016/j.fss.2008.06.018[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Zhou|first=S. M.|coauthors=F. Chiclana, R. I. John and J. M. Garibaldi|title=Alpha-level aggregation: a practical approach to type-1 OWA operation for aggregating uncertain information with applications to breast cancer treatments|journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering|year=2011|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1455–1468|doi=10.1109/TKDE.2010.191[/tpl]  have been proposed for this purpose. So the type-1 OWA operators provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

==Programming Problems for Type-1 OWA Operators==

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
A fast method has been presented to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently, for details, please see the paper.
