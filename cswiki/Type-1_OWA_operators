The Yager's OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators are more suitable for representing preferences of criteria in decision making. But fuzzy sets are not crisp values, how can we aggregate fuzzy sets in OWA mechanism? 
The type-1 OWA operators  have been proposed for this purpose. So the type-1 OWA operators provides us with a new technique for directly aggregating uncertain information with uncertain weights via OWA mechanism in soft decision making and data mining, where these uncertain objects are modelled by fuzzy sets.

The definition below is based on the alpha-cuts of fuzzy sets:

== Representation Theorem of Type-1 OWA Operators==

==Programming Problems for Type-1 OWA Operators==

For the left end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
while for the right end-points, we need to solve the following programming problem:
A fast method has been presented to solve two programming problem so that the type-1 OWA aggregation operation can be performed efficiently, for details, please see the paper.

== Alpha-Level Approach to Type-1 OWA Operation==

==Special Cases of Type-1 OWA Operators==

* Any OWA operators, like maximum, minimum, mean operators;
* Join operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets, i.e., fuzzy maximum operators;  
* Meet operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets, i.e., fuzzy minimum operators;
* Join-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets; 
* Meet-like operators of (type-1) fuzzy sets.

==Generalizations==

Type-2 OWA operators have been suggested to aggregate the type-2 fuzzy sets for soft decision making.
