UsiXML (USer Interface eXtensible Markup Language) is an XML-based markup language for defining user interfaces on computers.
UsiXML is a specification language for user interface design. It allows the designer to describe a user interface at different levels of abstraction. In other words you can specify a UI in terms of functionality (task analysis), object it manipulates, or, in a more concrete way, you can draw user interfaces.
The UsiXML language is currently being submitted for a standardisation plan to the W3C.
