VDownloader is software originally developed by Enrique Puertas Sanz, an ICT professor at the Universidad Europea de Madrid. The application was released as freeware in 2007. Half way through 2008, VDownloader reached the milestone of 8 million active users. In 2009, VDownloader was acquired by Vitzo Limited, a software development and online marketing company. Within just a few months, Vitzo released VDownloader 2.0 which was developed from scratch in C#.NET to replace the original Pascal-based application.
In November 2010, Vitzo released VDownloader 3.0 and branched the product into a Free and Plus version. This latest generation of VDownloader featured some never-before-seen features among video downloading software, such as fully automated feed downloads, a download planner/scheduler and Facebook integration. Other new additions included the integrated DVD burner, the History feature which is basically a stream catcher allowing videos watched in the browser to be saved/converted without downloading it again, and the option to convert videos from the hard disk through fully configurable output formats.
With VDownloader users can download videos from websites such as YouTube, Google, DailyMotion, MySpace, Porkolt, Metacafe, Break, 123 Video, Bolt, VSocial and Yahoo. The files are saved to the hard drive and can be automatically encoded as MPEG, AVI, VCD, DVD, iPod, PSPS or FLV.
