==History==

Bjorn S. Nilsson ported NCSA Mosaic 1.2 to VMS in the summer of 1993.[tpl]cite web |url=ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/Mosaic/Contrib/README.VMS |title=README.VMS |year=1993 |publisher=National Center for Supercomputing Applications |first=Bjorn |last=Nilsson |accessdate=2007-11-02[/tpl] When NCSA stopped development of NCSA Mosaic at version 2.7b5 in January 1997, several small groups of software developers continued work on Mosaic. Two of the resulting browsers were VMS Mosaic and mMosaic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/9610_Workshop/paper05/paper05.html |title=W3C mMosaic |last=dauphin |first=Gilles |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |year=1996 |accessdate=2007-11-02[/tpl] Although work on mMosaic stopped in 2004, much of its HTML engine has been incorporated into VMS Mosaic.NCSA and VMS Mosaic Version Information
