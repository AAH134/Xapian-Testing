Virtual Rendezvous is the name of an on-going open software effort, and the virtual corporation supporting it, whose short name is Rendezvous.

==History==

"Virtual Rendezvous" was the name chosen by Charles L. Perkins in 1993 for the virtual corporation (founded the year before) that focused on the social aspects of the emerging broadband networks of that era.  A Web site http://rendezvous.com to chronicle its various efforts over the years was created that same year, at first for use by the NeXT-only WorldWideWeb, then by the Mosaic browser, and finally by Netscape and later browsers.
During the long odyssey that followed, through many partners and teams of volunteers, and through 3DO University for US West (phone company)'s cable network, Time Warner's Full Service Network, and beta-testing Continental Cablevision's 2nd consumer cable modem in the world;  then creating holographic audio spaces for Video On Demand tests, 3D Virtual Reality, immersive user interfaces, and location-based entertainment;  through early relationships with Netscape Communications, firstperson (the Sun Microsystems spin-off that created the Java (Sun) Java platform), Wildfire Communications, Tellme Networks http://www.tellme.com/, and others;  through contributing ideas to Firefly (website), Abuzz, Alexa Internet, and Keen http://www.keen.com/;  and finally, seeking a commercial arm for server support through various CEOs and business plans in 1995â€“2000, the company has re-invented itself numerous times to reach its ambitious goals.
Since 2009, efforts 


have focused on creating a non-profit Foundation http://www.rendezvous.com/rendezvous/Foundation.html that when fully funded, will educate the public, fight for privacy rights online and in the public policy sphere, and manage and integrate many disparate open software efforts: Project Diaspora http://www.joindiaspora.com, JXTA (and JXME http://jxta-jxme.dev.java.net/), Jini, the Eclipse (computing) and Modeling Framework http://www.eclipse.org/emf/, Project Looking Glass, OpenSimulator (Second Life), and the Pando (application) (BitTorrent_(protocol)), while using Clojure and the Ruby programming language (and, optionally the Scala_(programming_language), to glue together the growing web of service-oriented applications and High_level_languages built on the Java ME platform as a Reference_implementation of the full-scale Virtual Rendezvous Service.
This Foundation, and the community supporting it, hope that these efforts, via interlocking, loosely coupled open standards, will soon result in a central resource for learning, protecting, and using the best tools for individual (identity) privacy via a universal real-time communication and collaboration meta-service (and 3D meta-world UI) available across all Ubiquitous_computing devices, fixed and portable, as its founders intended.
