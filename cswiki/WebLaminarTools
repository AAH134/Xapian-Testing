==Usage==

The combination of documentation, collaboration and tools attempts to support Kolb's experiential learning model.  A portable platform was chosen for ease of use and zero installation requirements.
* Collecting concrete experience, - wiki documentation with collaboration - group thought
* Observation of and reflection on that experience, - reviewing the wiki - models, visualizations, videos
* Formation of abstract concepts based upon the reflection, - brainstorming for procedures, solutions and implementations. - mind map, forum
* Testing the new concepts, - Admin. tools integrated in the wiki

=== Study group ===

The ease of installation and MediaWiki plug-ins allows the student or group to create a private wiki for collaboration and knowledge sharing.  Security can be set to allow only your team to view and edit.

=== IT Administration ===

The distribution of IT administration is organized to help the user achieve greater effectiveness by incrementally building on the lessons of the previous day in a personal wiki.  Search capabilities and a customizable menu system make the wiki ideal to ease retrieval of data. You can make decisions quicker and become proactive.

=== Entrepreneur/Scientist ===

The Entrepreneur/Scientist mashup is collated to help with brainstorming, idea formation, hypothesis testing and factual reporting.  It has business infrastructure tools to support finance, sales and support for a fledgling start-up so you can concentrate on the business at hand.  It is intended to be a personal or team notebook that can be built on as your ideas and business pursuits expand.
All WebLaminarTools distributions can securely enable access to the wiki through the use of MoWeS technology.
