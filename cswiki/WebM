WebM is an audio-video format designed to provide royalty-free, open video compression for use with HTML5 video. The project's development is sponsored by Google Inc.
A WebM file consists of VP8 video and Vorbis audio streams, in a container based on a profile of Matroska.

==Vendor support==

===Software===

Native WebM support by Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome was announced at the 2010 Google I/O conference. Internet Explorer 9 requires third-party WebM software. Safari for Windows and Mac OS X relies on QuickTime to play web media, which , a public preview version of this plug-in is available for Internet Explorer 9.
Adobe Systems announced that its Flash Player will be updated to support WebM, but no exact date was specified for its addition. 
Media players such as VLC, Haali Media Splitter has also announced support for muxing/demuxing of WebM. As of version 1.4.9, the LiVES video editor has support for realtime decoding and for encoding to WebM format using ffmpeg libraries.
MPC-HC as of SVN 2071 and higher builds supports WebM playback with internal VP8 decoder based on FFmpeg's code.
Android is WebM-enabled since version 2.3 - Gingerbread, which was first made available via the Nexus S mobile phone.

===Hardware===

WebM Project licenses VP8 hardware accelerators (RTL IP) to semiconductor companies for 1080p encoding and decoding at zero cost.
Chip&Media have announced a fully hardware decoder for VP8 that can decode full HD resolution VP8 streams at 60 frames per second.
NVIDIA has stated that they support VP8 adoption, but they have no specific plans to provide hardware support.
On 7 January 2011, Rockchip released the world's first chip to host a full hardware implementation of 1080p VP8 decoding. The video acceleration in the RK29xx chip is handled by the WebM Project's G-Series 1 hardware decoder IP.
In June 2011, ZiiLABS demonstrated their 1080p VP8 decoder implementation running on the ZMS-20 processor. The chips programmable media processing array is used to provide the VP8 acceleration.

===Services===

YouTube offers WebM videos as part of its HTML5 player experiment. All uploaded files are encoded into WebM in 360p, 480p, 720p and 1080p resolutions. YouTube has committed to encode its entire portfolio of videos to WebM.

==Licensing==

In mid-2010, Simon Phipps, a board member for the Open Source Initiative, expressed doubts as to whether the original WebM license was an open-source license, since it had not been submitted to the OSI for approval.
Although Google has irrevocably released all of its patents on VP8 as a royalty-free format,
