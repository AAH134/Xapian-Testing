Web Intents is an upcoming framework for web-based inter-application communication and service discovery.
Web Intents consists of a discovery mechanism and a very light-weight RPC system between web applications, modeled after the Intents system in Android. 
In the context of the framework an Intent equals an action to be performed by a provider.GitHub: Paul Kinlan: WebIntents
Web Intents allow two web applications to communicate with each other, without either of them having to actually know what the other one is.TechCrunch: Google Announces Plans To Bake Android-Like Web Intents Into Chrome

==History==

The Web Intents project was announced by Paul Kinlan from Google in December 2010. He soon released a prototype API to GitHub. In August 2011 Google announced that Chrome will support Web Intents, and they are cooperating with Mozilla to unify Web Intents and Mozilla's Web Activities/Web Discovery (which tries to solve the same problem) into one proposal.Chromium Blog: Connecting Web Apps with Web IntentsTechCrunch: Mozilla Labs Launches 'Web Activities' Experiment, Lets Web Apps Talk To Each OtherMozilla Labs: Web Apps Update – experiments in Web Activities, App Discovery
