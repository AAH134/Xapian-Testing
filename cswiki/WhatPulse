WhatPulse is a key counting program which monitors the number of keystrokes and mouseclicks, and more recently the distance the mouse moves, that a user makes over a period of time. The program is not spyware,http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/whatpulse.org Download tests from McAfee Site Advisor as it does not record the keys that are pressed (software that does this is called a keylogger), but instead measures the number of times that keys are pressed. In this way, one can see the number of keystrokes and mouseclicks over a period of time.

==Features==

The software also enables a user to see the frequency at which he or she types different letters on a keyboard. It enables that user to see how fast he or she is typing over a period of time by taking an average over that period.
As of version 1.5.0 Whatpulse also records the distance that the user's mouse moves across the screen. The user is able to set what measurement is shown: mile, kilometer, or meter. This enables the user to see just when and how much they use the mouse.
Periodically, one can upload the number of keystrokes that one makes to the server; this is called "pulsing". Users can see where they are in the leaderboard of people who have joined the program and compare themselves against people from their own countries. Users can also join teams, which enables them to compare themselves against people with similar interests. As of December 19, 2009, more than 155,000 users are active on WhatPulse, and that amount is rapidly growing.

==Cheating==

There is a very large and strong "WhatPulse" anti-cheat team being formed to help stop cheating for WhatPulse. Version 1.5.0 includes many anti-cheat measures.
Despite these measures, there is typically a lot of blatant cheating, which is against site rules.
The site rules state that activity "must be done with your own two hands."http://whatpulse.org/wiki/Are_there_any_rules%3F
Automated measures against cheating include a 7 average kps maximum.http://whatpulse.org/wiki/What_does_activity_breached_mean%3F
