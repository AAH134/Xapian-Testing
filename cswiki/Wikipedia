It is estimated that Wikipedia receives 2.7 billion monthly pageviews from the United States alone.
Wikipedia was launched in January 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined the name Wikipedia,How I started Wikipedia, presentation by Larry Sanger which is a portmanteau of wiki (a type of collaborative website, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick")"wiki" in the Hawaiian Dictionary, Revised and Enlarged Edition, University of Hawaii Press, 1986 and encyclo'pedia'.
Wikipedia's departure from the expert-driven style of encyclopedia building and the presence of a large body of unacademic content have received extensive attention in print media. In its 2006 Person of the Year article, Time magazine recognized the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people around the world. It cited Wikipedia as an example, in addition to YouTube, MySpace, and Facebook. Wikipedia has also been praised as a news source because of how quickly articles about recent events appear. Students have been assigned to write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clearly and succinctly explaining difficult concepts to an uninitiated audience.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Engaging with the World: Students of Comparative Law Write for Wikipedia|publisher=Legal Education Review|volume=19|issue=1 and 2|year=2009|pages=83–98|author=Witzleb, Normann|postscript=[/tpl]
Although the policies of Wikipedia strongly espouse [tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiability[/tpl] and a [tpl]srlink|WP:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view[/tpl], criticisms leveled at Wikipedia include allegations about quality of writing,Wikipedia:About - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia inaccurate or inconsistent information, and explicit content.

Other disparagers of Wikipedia simply point out vulnerabilities inherent to any wiki that may be edited by anyone. These critics observe that much weight is given to topics that more editors are likely to know about, like popular culture, and that the site is vulnerable to vandalism, though some studies indicate that vandalism is quickly deleted.  Critics point out that some articles contain unverified or inconsistent information, though a 2005 investigation in Nature showed that the science articles they compared came close to the level of accuracy of Encyclopædia Britannica and had a similar rate of "serious errors".

==History==

Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, Inc, a web portal company. Its main figures were the Bomis CEO Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of Richard Stallman. Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia. While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, Sanger is usually credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikipedia-l/2001-October/000671.html|title=Wikipedia-l: LinkBacks?|accessdate=February 20, 2007[/tpl] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.[tpl]Cite news|first=Larry |last=Sanger|title=Let's Make a Wiki|date=January 10, 2001|publisher=Internet Archive|url=http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/nupedia-l/2001-January/000676.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030414014355/http://www.nupedia.com/pipermail/nupedia-l/2001-January/000676.html|archivedate=April 14, 2003 |accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl]
Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com, and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view" was codified in its initial months, and was similar to Nupedia's earlier "nonbiased" policy. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. It grew to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions by the end of 2001. By late 2002, it had reached 26 language editions, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004."[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Multilingual statistics |title=Multilingual statistics |work=Wikipedia |date=March 30, 2005 |accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. English Wikipedia passed the two million-article mark on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, eclipsing even the 1407 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for exactly 600 years.
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in a [tpl]Citation needed span|perceived English-centric|date=May 2012[/tpl] Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[tpl]cite web|title=|url=http://osdir.com/ml/science.linguistics.wikipedia.international/2003-03/msg00008.html |work=Osdir |accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl] These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org. 
Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/aug/12/wikipedia-deletionist-inclusionist |title=Wikipedia approaches its limits |author=Bobbie Johnson |work=The Guardian |location=London | date=August 12, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010[/tpl] Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2010 that average was roughly 1,000.[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Size of Wikipedia#Annual growth rate|Size of Wikipedia[/tpl] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.[tpl]cite conference |url=http://www.wikisym.org/ws2009/procfiles/p108-suh.pdf |title=The Singularity is Not Near: Slowing Growth of Wikipedia |year=2009|location=Orlando, Florida |conference=the International Symposium on Wikis[/tpl]  Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called 'low-hanging fruit' – topics that clearly merit an article – have already been created and built up extensively.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/BR34.6/morozov.php |title=Edit This Page; Is it the end of Wikipedia |publisher=Boston Review |author=Evgeny Morozov[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Cohen |first=Noam |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/weekinreview/29cohen.html |title=Wikipedia – Exploring Fact City |work=The New York Times |date=March 28, 2009 |accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/nov/26/wikipedia-losing-disgruntled-editors |title=Wikipedia falling victim to a war of words |work=The Guardian |location=London |author=Jenny Kleeman | date=November 26, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|url=http://libresoft.es/publications/thesis-jfelipe |title=Wikipedia: A quantitative analysis |format=PDF[/tpl] The Wall Street Journal reported that "unprecedented numbers of the millions of online volunteers who write, edit and police Wikipedia are quitting".

Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/6660646/Wikipedias-Jimmy-Wales-denies-site-is-losing-thousands-of-volunteer-editors.html |title=Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales denies site is 'losing' thousands of volunteer editors |publisher=Telegraph | location=London | date=November 26, 2009 | accessdate=March 31, 2010 | first=Emma | last=Barnett[/tpl] Two years later, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. Nevertheless, in the same interview he claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable".
In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top ten list of the most popular websites in the United States, according to comScore Networks Inc. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked No. 9, surpassing the New York Times (#10) and Apple Inc. (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was No. 33, with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/129135/wikipedia_breaks_into_us_top_10_sites.html |title=Wikipedia Breaks Into U.S. Top 10 Sites |publisher=PCWorld |date=February 17, 2007[/tpl] As of May 2012, Wikipedia is the sixth-most-popular website worldwide according to Alexa Internet,http://www.alexa.com/topsites Alexa Internet Top Sites. receiving more than 2.7 billion U.S. pageviews every month, out of a global monthly total of over 12 billion pageviews.http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerCountryOverview.htm Wikimedia Statistics, April 20, 2011.

===Editing===

In a departure from the style of traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia is largely open. This means that, except for particularly sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages, which would be "protected" from some degree of editing, the reader of an article can edit the text as he sees fits, anonymously or with a user account. Different language editions modify this policy; for example, only registered users may create a new article in the English edition. No article is owned by its creator or any other editor, nor is any vetted by any recognized authority. Instead, editors agree on the content and structure of articles by [tpl]srlink|WP:CONSENSUS|consensus[/tpl].[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Ownership of articles|Ownership of articles[/tpl]
By default, an edit to an article becomes available immediately, prior to any review. As such, an article may contain inaccuracies, ideological biases, or even patent nonsense, until or unless another editor corrects the problem. Different language editions, each under separate administrative control, are free to modify this policy. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of articles,[tpl]cite mailing list|first=P. |last=Birken |url=http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikide-l/2008-December/021594.html |title=Bericht Gesichtete Versionen |mailinglist=Wikide-l |date=December 14, 2008 |language=German |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=February 15, 2009[/tpl] which have passed certain reviews. Notably, however, the English Wikipedia does not use the German model. In 2010 the former conducted a two-month trial of a "pending changes" system wherein new users' edits to certain "controversial" or vandalism-prone articles would be "subject to review from an established Wikipedia editor before publication". In a discussion following the trial, the community failed to reach consensus as to whether or not to keep the "pending changes" system. Thus, all remaining pending changes were removed from article pages in May 2011.[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Pending changes/Request for Comment February 2011[/tpl]
Contributors, whether registered or not, can take advantage of features available in the software that powers Wikipedia. The "History" page belonging to each article records every single past revision of the article, though a revision with libelous content, criminal threats or copyright infringements may be removed retroactively.The Japanese Wikipedia, for example, is known for deleting every mention of real names of victims of certain high-profile crimes, even when they still appear in other language editions. Editors can use this page to undo undesirable changes or restore lost content. The "Talk" page associated with each article helps coordinate work among multiple editors.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/wikipedia_coordination_final.pdf|format=PDF|author=Fernanda B. Viégas, Martin Wattenberg, Jesse Kriss, Frank van Ham|title=Talk Before You Type: Coordination in Wikipedia|publisher=Visual Communication Lab, IBM Research|date=January 3, 2007|accessdate=June 27, 2008[/tpl] Importantly, editors may use the "Talk" page to reach "consensus",Wikipedia:Consensus sometimes through the use of polling.
In addition, editors may view the most "recent changes" to the website, which are displayed in reverse chronology. Regular contributors often maintain a "watchlist" of articles of interest to them, in order to easily track recent changes to those articles. In language editions with many articles, editors tend to prefer the "watchlist" because the number of edits has become too large to follow in "recent changes." New page patrol is "a process by which newly created articles are checked for obvious problems."Wikipedia:New pages patrol A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected, allowing only well established users to edit it.English Wikipedia's semi-protection policy A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Full protection|English Wikipedia's full protection policy[/tpl]
Computer programs called bots have been used widely to correct common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. There are also some bots that are designed to detect attacks and fix them automatically (or semi-automatically), filters that warn users making "undesirable" edits,[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2009-03-23/Abuse_Filter |title=Wikipedia signpost: Abuse Filter is enabled |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 13, 2010[/tpl] blocks on the creation of links to particular websites, and blocks on edits from particular accounts, IP addresses or address ranges.

=== Organization of article pages ===

Articles in Wikipedia are loosely organized according to their [tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|development status[/tpl] and [tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Categorization|subject matter[/tpl]. Categories help organize each article by its content and properties.Wikipedia:Categorization A new article often starts as a 'stub', a very short page consisting of definitions and some links. On the other extreme, the most developed articles may be nominated for "featured article" status. One "featured article" per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of Wikipedia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2365/2182 |title=First Monday |publisher=First Monday |accessdate=July 13, 2010[/tpl] Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of few editors.Poderi, Giacomo, Wikipedia and the Featured Articles: How a Technological System Can Produce Best Quality Articles, (Master thesis), University of Maastricht, October 2008, In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English-language Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale against which the quality of articles is judged.
A group of Wikipedia editors may form a WikiProject to focus their work on a specific topic area, using its associated discussion page to coordinate changes across multiple articles.

===Vandalism===

The most common and obvious types of vandalism include insertion of false information, advertising language, highly partisan or opinionated language, or other types of spam.Wikipedia:Vandalism Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing information or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism can be more difficult to detect. Those committing vandalism can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or utilize images disruptively.
The opportunity for vandalism provides a number of unique challenges to Wikipedia. One particular criticism is that, at any moment, a reader of an article cannot be certain that it has not been compromised by the insertion of false information or the removal of essential information. Former Encyclopædia Britannica editor-in-chief Robert McHenry once described the predicament using simile:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caslon.com.au/wikiprofile1.htm |title=Caslon.com |publisher=Caslon.com |accessdate=July 13, 2010[/tpl]

Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from wiki articles; in practice, the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes. However, in one high-profile incident, false information was introduced into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler and remained undetected for four months. John Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wales and asked if he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[tpl]cite book|last=Friedman|first=Thomas L.|title=The World is Flat|year=2007|publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-29278-2|page=124[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070212171844/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=17798 |title=Founder shares cautionary tale of libel in cyberspace By Brian J. Buchanan |publisher=Firstamendmentcenter.org |date=November 30, 2005 |accessdate=July 13, 2010[/tpl] This incident led to policy changes on the site, specifically targeted at tightening up the verifiability of all [tpl]srlink|WP:BLP|biographical articles of living people[/tpl].

===Rules and laws governing content and editor behavior===

Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, the copyright laws) of the United States and of the U.S. state of Florida, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers reside. Beyond legal matters, the editorial principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the "[tpl]srlink|WP:Five pillars|five pillars[/tpl]", and numerous [tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines|policies and guidelines[/tpl] that are intended to shape the content appropriately. Even these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors as a community write and revise the website's policies and guidelines.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1866322157;fp;2;fpid;2 |title=Who's behind Wikipedia?|publisher=PC World |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2008[/tpl] Editors can enforce rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules on the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.

====English Wikipedia====

=====Content policies=====

According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia to be worthy of inclusion must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-like.[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ISNOT |title=Wikipedia:ISNOT |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |quote=Wikipedia is not a dictionary, usage, or jargon guide.[/tpl] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of "notability",[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability |title=Wikipedia:Notability |accessdate=February 13, 2008 |quote=A topic is presumed to be notable if it has received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject.[/tpl] which usually means that it must have received significant coverage in reliable secondary sources such as mainstream media or major academic journals that are independent of the subject of the topic. Further, Wikipedia intends only to convey knowledge that is already established and recognized. It must not present new information or original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability |title= Wikipedia:Verifiability |accessdate=February 13, 2008 |quote=Material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed to a reliable, published source.[/tpl] This can lead to the removal of information that is valid, thus hindering inclusion of knowledge and growth of the encyclopedia.[tpl]Cite news | last = Cohen | first = Noam | title = For inclusive mission, Wikipedia is told that written word goes only so far | newspaper = International Herald Tribune | page = 18 | date = August 9, 2011 | url = | quote =In the case of of dabba kali, a children's game played in the Indian state of Kerala there was a Wikipedia article in the local language, Malayalam, that included photos, a drawing, and a detailed description of the rules. but no sources to back up what was written. Other than, of course the 40 million people who played it as children. There is no doubt...that the article would have been deleted from English Wikipedia if it not had any sources to cite. Those are the rules of the game. | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Finally, Wikipedia must not take a side. All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources, must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/61365/?page=entire|title=Will Unethical Editing Destroy Wikipedia's Credibility?|author=Eric Haas|publisher=AlterNet.org|date=October 26, 2007|accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl] This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).

=====Dispute resolution=====

Wikipedia has many methods of settling disputes. A "BOLD, revert, discuss" cycle sometimes occurs, in which an editor changes something, another editor reverts the change, and then the two editors discuss the issue on a talk page. When editors disregard this process, an edit war may begin, in which a change is repeatedly done by one editor and then undone by another.MSNBC Wikipedia is editorial warzone, says study
In order to gain a broader community consensus, editors can raise issues at the Village Pump, or initiate a Request for Comment. An editor can report impolite, uncivil, or otherwise problematic communications with another editor via the "Wikiquette Assistance" noticeboard. Such postings themselves have no binding or disciplinary power. Specialized forums exist for centralizing discussion on specific decisions, such as whether or not an article should be deleted. Mediation is sometimes used, although it has been deemed by some Wikipedians to be unhelpful for resolving particularly contentious disputes.

======Arbitration ======

The Arbitration Committee is the ultimate dispute resolution method. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how articles should read[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl], the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on which view should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and focuses on the way disputes are conducted instead,[tpl]Cite journal|title=Wikitruth through Wikiorder|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/59/59.1/Hoffman_Mehra.pdf|publisher=Emory Law Journal|volume=59|issue=1|year=2009|page=181|author=Hoffman, David A.; Mehra, Salil K.[/tpl] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63.2% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43.3%), subject matters (23.4%) or Wikipedia (15.7%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are largely limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or violating editing policies, warnings tend to be issued.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Wikitruth through Wikiorder|url=http://www.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/journals/elj/59/59.1/Hoffman_Mehra.pdf|publisher=Emory Law Journal|volume=59|issue=1|year=2009|pages=151–210|author=Hoffman, David A.; Mehra, Salil K.|postscript=[/tpl]

===Privacy===

One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain private; to remain a "private citizen" rather than a "public figure" in the eyes of the law.See "Libel" by David McHam for the legal distinction It is somewhat of a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life ("meatspace"). Wikipedia Watch argues that "Wikipedia is a potential menace to anyone who values privacy" and that "a greater degree of accountability in the Wikipedia structure" would be "the very first step toward resolving the privacy problem."Wikipedia's Hive Mind Administration[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl], November 9, 2005 (copy of original text at Google Blogoscoped) A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against their wishes.
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka "Tron", a deceased hacker who was formerly with the Chaos Computer Club. More specifically, the court ordered that the URL within the German .de domain (http://www.wikipedia.de/) may no longer redirect to the encyclopedia's servers in Florida at http://de.wikipedia.org although German readers were still able to use the US-based URL directly, and there was virtually no loss of access on their part. The court order arose out of a lawsuit filed by Floricic's parents, demanding that their son's surname be removed from Wikipedia.[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2006-01-16/Tron_dispute|date=January 16, 2006|work=Wikipedia Signpost|publisher=Wikipedia|title=Tron dispute[/tpl] On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents were being violated.[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Gericht-weist-einstweilige-Verfuegung-gegen-Wikimedia-Deutschland-ab-Update-173587.html heise online – Gericht weist einstweilige Verfügung gegen Wikimedia Deutschland ab Update, by Torsten Kleinz, February 9, 2006.

===Community===

Wikipedia's community has been described as "cult-like," although not always with entirely negative connotations, and criticized for failing to accommodate inexperienced users.[ref]"
[/ref]
 The project's preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of [[credential]]s,  has been referred to as "[[anti-elitism]]".<ref>[tpl]cite web|title=Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25|work=Kuro5hin.org|author=Larry Sanger|page=Op-Ed|date=31 December 2004|quote=There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups...that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you... demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry "censorship," attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem...which explains both of the above... as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist... expertise is not accorded any special respect. This is one of my failures|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl]</ref>

==== Power structure ====

The Wikipedia community has established "a bureaucracy of sorts", including "a clear power structure that gives volunteer administrators the authority to exercise editorial control."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2184487 |title=The Wisdom of the Chaperones |date=February 22, 2008 |first=Chris |last=Wilson |publisher=Slate |accessdate=March 4, 2008[/tpl]
Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship; this begins with "administrator,"[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Administrators[/tpl] a group of privileged users who have the ability to delete pages, lock articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes, and block users from editing. Despite the name, administrators do not enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to block users making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_conduct |title=Wikipedia:Administrators |accessdate=July 12, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |title=Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |accessdate=September 24, 2009[/tpl]

==== Contributors ====

Wikipedia does not require that its users provide identification. However, as Wikipedia grows with its unconventional model of encyclopedia building, "Who writes Wikipedia?" has become one of the questions frequently asked on the project, often with a reference to other Web 2.0 projects such as Digg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viktoria.se/altchi/submissions/submission_edchi_1.pdf |title=Power of the Few vs. Wisdom of the Crowd: Wikipedia and the Rise of the Bourgeoisie |first=Aniket |last=Kittur |format=PDF | accessdate=February 23, 2008[/tpl] Wales once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional organization." Wales performed a study finding that over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users (at the time: 524 people). This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia |title=Raw Thought: Who Writes Wikipedia? |first=Aaron |last=Swartz |date=September 4, 2006 |accessdate=February 23, 2008[/tpl] A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site."
Although some contributors are authorities in their field, Wikipedia requires that even their contributions be supported by published and verifiable sources.
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in wiki software create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that a "creative construction" approach encourages participation.[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2012[/tpl][ref]

==== Interactions ====

Members of the community predominantly interact with each other via 'talk' pages, which are wiki-edited pages which are associated with articles, as well as via talk pages that are specific to particular contributors, and talk pages that help run the site. These pages help the contributors reach consensus about what the contents of the articles should be, how the site's rules may change, and to take actions with respect to any problems within the community.Help:Using talk pages – "A talk page (also known as a discussion page) is a page which editors can use to discuss improvements to an article or other Wikipedia page."

==== Positive re-inforcement ====

Wikipedians sometimes award one another barnstars for good work. These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support, administrative actions, and types of articulation work. The barnstar phenomenon has been analyzed by researchers seeking to determine what implications it might have for other communities engaged in large-scale collaborations.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Articulations of wikiwork: uncovering valued work in Wikipedia through barnstars|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1460563.1460573|publisher=Proceedings of the ACM|author=T Kriplean|year=2008|postscript=|doi=10.1145/1460563.1460573|page=47|chapter=Articulations of wikiwork|isbn=978-1-60558-007-4|author-separator=,|author2=I Beschastnikh|display-authors=2|last3=McDonald|first3=David W.[/tpl]

==== New users ====

60% of registered users never make another edit after their first 24 hours. Possible explanations are that such users only register for a single purpose, or are scared away by their experiences.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Panciera, Katherine|title=Wikipedians Are Born, Not Made|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Supporting Group Work|pages=51, 59|year=2009|postscript=|display-authors=1|author2=[/tpl] Goldman writes that editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk pages, implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders will target their contributions as a threat. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs; the contributor is expected to build a user page, learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to an arcane dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references." Non-logged-in users are in some sense second-class citizens on Wikipedia,[tpl]Cite journal|title=Wikipedia's Labor Squeeze and its Consequences|publisher=Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law|author=Goldman, Eric|volume=8|postscript=[/tpl] as "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation,"[tpl]Cite journal|title=Wikipedia and the Future of Legal Education|author=Noveck, Beth Simone|publisher=Journal of Legal Education|volume=57|postscript=[/tpl] but the contribution histories of IP addresses cannot necessarily with any certainty be credited to, or blamed upon, a particular user.
A 2009 study by Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/1/who-the-hell-writes-wikipedia-anyway | title=Who The Hell Writes Wikipedia, Anyway? | work=Business Insider | date=January 3, 2009 | accessdate=July 23, 2011 | author=Blodget, Henry[/tpl] showed that in a random sample of articles most content in Wikipedia (measured by the amount of contributed text which survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders" (users with low edit counts), while most editing and formatting is done by "insiders" (a select group of established users).

==== Demographics ====

One study found that the contributor base to Wikipedia "was barely 13% women; the average age of a contributor was in the mid-20s." Sue Gardner, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation, hopes to see female editing contributions increase to 25% by 2015.[tpl]cite news|last=Chom|first=Noam|title=Define Gender Gap?

thumb|Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions.In a research article published in PLoS ONE in 2012, Yasseri et al. based on the circadian patterns of editorial activities of the community, have estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. For instance, it has been reported that edits from North America are limited to almost 50% in the English Wikipedia and this value decreases to 25% in Simple English Wikipedia. The article also covers some other editions in different languages.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030091 | title=Circadian Patterns of Wikipedia Editorial Activity: A Demographic Analysis | date=January 17, 2012 | accessdate=January 17, 2012 | publisher= PLoS ONE |author=Taha Yasseri, Robert Sumi, János Kertész[/tpl] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to 37% by 2015.[tpl]cite web|title=Wikimedia Foundation 2011-12 Annual Plan|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/37/2011-12_Wikimedia_Foundation_Plan_FINAL_FOR_WEBSITE_.pdf|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|page=8[/tpl]

===Language editions===

There are currently 285 language editions (or language versions) of Wikipedia; of these, 4 have over 1 million articles each (English, German, French and Dutch), 6 more have over 700,000 articles (Italian, Polish, Spanish, Russian, Japanese and Portuguese), 40 more have over 100,000 articles and 109 have over 10,000 articles. The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over [tpl]#expr: 0.1*floor([tpl]NUMBEROFARTICLES:R[/tpl]/100000)[/tpl] million articles. According to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 54% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Japanese: 10%, German: 8%, Spanish: 5%, Russian: 4%, French: 4%, Italian: 3%). As of January 2012, the five largest language editions are (in order of article count) English, German, French, Dutch, and Italian Wikipedias.
Since Wikipedia is web-based and therefore worldwide, contributors of a same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences, (e.g. color vs. colour)[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spelling|title= spelling | work = Manual of Style | publisher = Wikipedia |accessdate=May 19, 2007[/tpl] or points of view.[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias|title=Countering systemic bias|accessdate=May 19, 2007[/tpl]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as "neutral point of view," they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.
Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language."Jimmy Wales, "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia," March 8, 2005,  Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others).[tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/|title=Meta-Wiki|accessdate=March 24, 2009|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation[/tpl] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Statistics|title=Meta-Wiki Statistics|accessdate=March 24, 2008|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation[/tpl] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_articles_every_Wikipedia_should_have|title=List of articles every Wikipedia should have|accessdate=March 24, 2008|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation[/tpl] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, foodstuffs, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because fully automated translation of articles is disallowed.[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translations |title=Wikipedia: Translation |work=English Wikipedia |accessdate=February 3, 2007[/tpl] Articles available in more than one language may offer "Interwiki links", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.

== Analysis of content ==

Although poorly-written articles are flagged for improvement,Wikipedia:Contact us/Article problem/Poorly written - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia critics note that the style and quality of individual articles may vary greatly. Others argue that inherent biases (willful or not) arise in the presentation of facts, especially controversial topics and public or historical figures. Although Wikipedia's stated mission is to provide information, not argue value judgements, yet some draw the censorship lineAbstracts Database - National Criminal Justice Reference Service more strictly than do articles focusing on unpleasant, highly specialized, arguably trivial, or arguably objectionable material.
In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism by Wikipedia editors on the English version. Wales has said in this respect: "We need to deal with such activities with absolute harshness, no mercy, because this kind of plagiarism is 100% at odds with all of our core principles."

===Accuracy of content===

Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are carefully and deliberately written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. On the other hand, Wikipedia is often cited for factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations. However, a non-scientific report in the journal Nature in 2005 suggested that for some scientific articles Wikipedia came close to the level of accuracy of Encyclopædia Britannica and had a similar rate of "serious errors." These claims have been disputed by, among others, Encyclopædia Britannica.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/press_releases/Britannica_response.pdf?item|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica and Nature: a response|accessdate=July 13, 2010[/tpl] The Nature report also concluded that the structure of Wikipedia's articles was often poor.
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of validity" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:General_disclaimer |title=Wikipedia:General disclaimer |publisher=English Wikipedia |accessdate=April 22, 2008[/tpl] Concerns have been raised regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of spurious information,[tpl]cite web|last=Raphel |first=JR|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/170874/the_15_biggest_wikipedia_blunders.html|title=The 15 Biggest Wikipedia Blunders |publisher=PC World|accessdate=September 2, 2009[/tpl] vandalism, and similar problems.  
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true, after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites, and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[tpl]Cite news|author=Stacy Schiff | date=July 31, 2006 |title = Know It All | work = The New Yorker[/tpl] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. Editors of traditional reference works such as theEncyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spamming, and those with an agenda to push. The addition of political spin to articles by organizations including members of the US House of Representatives and special interest groups has been noted, and organizations such as Microsoft have offered financial incentives to work on certain articles. These issues have been parodied, notably by Stephen Colbert in The Colbert Report. For example, in August 2007, the website WikiScanner began to trace the sources of changes made to Wikipedia by anonymous editors without Wikipedia accounts. The program revealed that many such edits were made by corporations or government agencies changing the content of articles related to them, their personnel or their work.

===Quality of writing===

Because contributors usually rewrite small portions of an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig, a history professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed Wikipedia in terms of its "clear and engaging prose", which, he said, was an important aspect of good historical writing. Contrasting Wikipedia's treatment of Abraham Lincoln to that of Civil War historian James McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised "McPherson's richer contextualization... his artful use of quotations to capture Lincoln's voice ... and ... his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words." By contrast, he gives an example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds "both verbose and dull". Rosenzweig also criticized the "waffling—encouraged by the npov policy—which means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia history." By example, he quoted the conclusion of Wikipedia's article on William Clarke Quantrill. While generally praising the article, he pointed out its "waffling" conclusion: "Some historians...remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero."
Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: "Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been translated from one language to another then into to a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/18/wikipedia_quality_problem/page2.html|title=Wikipedia founder admits to serious quality problems|author=Andrew Orlowski|date=October 18, 2005|work=The Register|accessdate=September 30, 2007[/tpl] A study of cancer articles by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University found that the entries were mostly accurate, but they were written at college reading level, as opposed to the ninth grade level seen in the Physician Data Query. He said that "Wikipedia's lack of readability may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2010/06/04/Wikipedia-cancer-information-accurate/UPI-87311275628573/|title=Wikipedia cancer information accurate|date=June 4, 2010|work=UPI|accessdate=December 31, 2010[/tpl] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: "inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8820422?story_id=8820422|title=Fact or fiction?

===Coverage of topics and systemic bias ===

Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic of knowledge covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any conventional printed encyclopedia.[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:PAPER[/tpl] It also contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic (cf below).[tpl]cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_censored |title=Wikipedia is not censored |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=April 30, 2008[/tpl] It was made clear that this policy is not up for debate, and the policy has sometimes proved controversial. For instance, in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in its English edition, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China, Pakistan[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/20/AR2010052005073.html|title=Pakistan blocks YouTube a day after shutdown of Facebook over Muhammad issue|first=Karin|last=Bruilliard|work=The Washington Post|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=October 24, 2011[/tpl] and the United Kingdom,[tpl]cite news |title=Wikipedia child image censored |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7770456.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=December 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 8, 2008[/tpl] among other countries.
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field:
* Culture and the arts: 30% (210%)
* Biographies and persons: 15% (97%)
* Geography and places: 14% (52%)
* Society and social sciences: 12% (83%)
* History and events: 11% (143%)
* Natural and the physical sciences: 9% (213%)
* Technology and the applied science: 4% (−6%)
* Religions and belief systems: 2% (38%)
* Health: 2% (42%)
* Mathematics and logic: 1% (146%)
* Thought and philosophy: 1% (160%)
These numbers refer only to the quantity of articles; it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short articles and another one contain a small number of large ones. Through its "Wikipedia Loves Libraries" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/theater/editing-wikipedia-at-the-new-york-public-library-for-the-performing-arts.html |title=Wikipedia’s Deep Dive Into a Library Collection |last=Petrusich |first=Amanda |work=The New York Times |date=October 20, 2011 |accessdate=October 28, 2011[/tpl]
Furthermore, the exact coverage of Wikipedia is under constant review by the editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see also deletionism and inclusionism).[tpl]Cite news|title=The battle for Wikipedia's soul |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10789354 |work=The Economist|date=March 6, 2008 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3354752/Wikipedia-an-online-encyclopedia-torn-apart.html|title=Wikipedia: an online encyclopedia torn apart |date=November 10, 2007|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=November 23, 2010|first=Ian|last=Douglas[/tpl]
[tpl]As of|2009|9[/tpl], Wikipedia articles cover about half a million places on Earth. However, research conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute has shown that the geographic distribution of articles is highly uneven. Most articles are written about North America, Europe, and East Asia, with very little coverage of large parts of the developing world, including most of Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://zerogeography.blogspot.com/2009/11/mapping-geographies-of-wikipedia.html |title=Mapping the Geographies of Wikipedia Content |work=Mark Graham Oxford Internet Institute|publisher=ZeroGeography |accessdate=November 16, 2009[/tpl]
When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, there may arise a systemic bias, such as non-opposite definitions for apparent antonyms. In 2011 Wales noted that the unevenness of the coverage is the reflection of the demography of the editors, which predominantly consists of young male with high educations in the developed world (cf. above)[tpl]cite news |title=Wikipedia seeks women to balance its 'geeky' editors |author=Kevin Rawlinson |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-seeks-women-to-balance-its-geeky-editors-2333605.html |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |newspaper=Independent |date=8 August 2011[/tpl]
A "selection bias"[tpl]cite journal |title=Selection Bias, Demographic Effects, and Ability Effects in Common Value Auction Experiments |first=Marco |last=Casari |first2=John C. |last2=Ham |first3=John H. |last3=Kagel |journal=American Economic Review |volume=97 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=1278–1304 |doi= |jstor=30034092 [/tpl] may arise when more words per article are devoted to one public figure than a rival public figure. Editors may dispute suspected biases and discuss controversial articles, sometimes at great length. Wales has noted the dangers of bias on controversial political topics or polarizing public figures.

===Citing Wikipedia===

Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources; some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[tpl]cite doi|10.1145/1284621.1284635[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|first=Scott |last=Jaschik |title=A Stand Against Wikipedia |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/01/26/wiki |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=January 26, 2007 |accessdate=January 27, 2007 [/tpl] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citeable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.
In February 2007 an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University include Wikipedia in their syllabi, but that there is a split in their perception of using Wikipedia.Child, Maxwell L.,"Professors Split on Wiki Debate", The Harvard Crimson, Monday, February 26, 2007. In June 2007 former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything." He also said that "a generation of intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the Internet" was being produced at universities. He complains that the web-based sources are discouraging students from learning from the more rare texts which are found only on paper or subscription-only web sites. In the same article Jenny Fry (a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute) commented on academics who cite Wikipedia, saying that: "You cannot say children are intellectually lazy because they are using the Internet when academics are using search engines in their research. The difference is that they have more experience of being critical about what is retrieved and whether it is authoritative. Children need to be told how to use the Internet in a critical and appropriate way."
A Harvard Law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general source" that "can be a real boon" in "coming up to speed in the law governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources."[tpl]cite book|last=Cohen|first=Morris|title=Legal Research in a Nutshell|year=2010|publisher=Thomson Reuters|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0-314-26408-4|pages=32–34|edition=10th|coauthors=Olson, Kent[/tpl]
Wales once said he receives about ten e-mails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia. According to The Sunday Times of London, Wales told the students they got what they deserved. "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia", he said."Jimmy Wales," Biography Resource Center Online. (Gale, 2006)

===Explicit content===

Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content. Articles depicting arguably objectionable content (such as feces, corpses, the human penis or vulva) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with the internet, including children.
The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation as well as photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles.
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer – a 1976 album from German heavy metal band Scorpions – features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom, after it was reported by a member of the public as child pornography,[tpl]Cite news|work=The Register|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/12/07/brit_isps_censor_wikipedia/|title=Brit ISPs censor Wikipedia over 'child porn' album cover|date=December 7, 2008|first=Cade|last=Metz|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl] to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) which issues a stop list to ISPs. IWF, a nonprofit, nongovernment-affiliated organization, later criticized the inclusion of the picture as "distasteful."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/08/AR2008120803188.html|work=The Washington Post|date=December 10, 2008|first=JR|last=Raphael|title=Wikipedia Censorship Sparks Free Speech Debate|accessdate=May 10, 2009[/tpl]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of U.S. federal obscenity law.[tpl]cite news|last=Farrell|first=Nick|title=Wikipedia denies child abuse allegations: Co-founder grassed the outfit to the FBI |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1603521/wikipedia-denies-child-abuse-allegations|accessdate=October 9, 2010|newspaper=The Inquirer|date=April 29, 2010[/tpl] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003. That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law. Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infotech/internet/Wikipedia-blasts-co-founders-accusations-of-child-porn-on-website/articleshow/5871943.cms|title=Wikipedia blasts co-founder's accusations of child porn on website|date=April 29, 2010|work=The Economic Times |location=India|accessdate=April 29, 2010[/tpl] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it." Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing list that this action was "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10104946.stm |title=Wikimedia pornography row deepens as Wales cedes rights |publisher=BBC News |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2010[/tpl]

==Operation==

===Wikimedia Foundation and the Wikimedia chapters===

Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks. The Wikimedia chapters, local associations of users and supporters of the Wikimedia projects, also participate in the promotion, development, and funding of the project.

===Software and hardware===

The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nedworks.org/~mark/presentations/san/Wikimedia%20architecture.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikimedia Architecture |author=Mark Bergman |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation Inc. |accessdate=June 27, 2008[/tpl] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software.
In April 2005 a Lucene extension was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1, which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3.
Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day."Monthly request statistics," Wikimedia. Retrieved on October 31, 2008. Page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Squid caching servers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://domasmituzas.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/mysqluc2007-wikipedia-workbook.pdf |format=PDF|title=Wikipedia: Site internals, configuration, code examples and management issues |author=Domas Mituzas |publisher=MySQL Users Conference 2007 |accessdate=June 27, 2008[/tpl] Further statistics are available based on a publicly available 3-months Wikipedia access trace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globule.org/publi/WWADH_comnet2009.html |title=Wikipedia Workload Analysis for Decentralized Hosting |author=Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre and Maarten van Steen |publisher=Elsevier Computer Networks 53(11), pp. 1830–1845, June 2009[/tpl] Requests that cannot be served from the Squid cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass the request to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.
Wikipedia employed a single server until 2004, when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture. In January 2005, the project ran on 39 dedicated servers in Florida. This configuration included a single master database server running MySQL, multiple slave database servers, 21 web servers running the Apache HTTP Server, and seven Squid cache servers. Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu),[tpl]cite news |title=Wikipedia simplifies IT infrastructure by moving to one Linux vendor |first=Todd R. |last=Weiss |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9116787/Wikipedia_simplifies_IT_infrastructure_by_moving_to_one_Linux_vendor?taxonomyId=154&pageNumber=1&taxonomyName=Servers%20and%20Data%20Center |newspaper=Computerworld |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=November 1, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Wikipedia adopts Ubuntu for its server infrastructure |first=Ryan |last=Paul |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/wikipedia-adopts-ubuntu-for-its-server-infrastructure.ars |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=November 1, 2008[/tpl] with a few OpenSolaris machines for ZFS. As of December 2009, there were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam.

== Access to content ==

===Content licensing===

When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work,[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Copyrights[/tpl] GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs that are licensed under GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work; for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL license text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general; not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, following the request of the project, in November 2008, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to [tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense its content to CC BY-SA[/tpl] by August 1, 2009. (A new version of GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Questions_and_Answers |title=Licensing update/Questions and Answers |work=Wikimedia Meta |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=February 15, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Timeline |title=Licensing_update/Timeline |work=Wikimedia Meta |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=April 5, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/05/21/wikimedia-community-approves-license-migration/ |title=Wikimedia community approves license migration |work=Wikimedia Foundation|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=May 21, 2009[/tpl]
The handling of media files (e.g., image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part due to the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g., in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g., Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.
The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSL0280486220071102?feedType=RSS&feedName=internetNews|title=Wikipedia cleared in French defamation case|publisher=Reuters|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=November 2, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080502-dumb-idea-suing-wikipedia-for-calling-you-dumb.html |title=Dumb idea: suing Wikipedia for calling you "dumb" |first=Nate |last=Anderson |date=May 2, 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |accessdate=May 4, 2008[/tpl]

===Methods of access===

Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse, or re-distribute it at no charge. The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website.
* Web sites – Thousands of "mirror sites" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones, that also include content from other reference sources, are Reference.com and Answers.com. Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.
* Mobile apps – A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on hand-held devices, including both Android and Apple iOS devices (see Wikipedia iOS apps). (See also Mobile access).
* Search engines – Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Bing (via technology gained from Powerset)With Bing Reference, Bing Community blog, July 27, 2009 and Duck Duck Go.
* Compact Discs, DVDs – Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained about 2,000 articles."Wikipedia on DVD". Linterweb. Accessed June 1, 2007. "Linterweb is authorized to make a commercial use of the Wikipedia trademark restricted to the selling of the Encyclopedia CDs and DVDs"."Wikipedia 0.5 Available on a CD-ROM". Wikipedia on DVD. Linterweb. Accessed June 1, 2007. "The DVD or CD-ROM version 0.5 was commercially available for purchase." The Polish-language version contains nearly 240,000 articles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polska_Wikipedia_na_DVD_%28z_Helionem%29/en |title=Polish Wikipedia on DVD |accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl] There are German and Spanish-language versions as well.[tpl]cite web|url=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia-Distribution |title=Wikipedia:DVD |accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://python.org.ar/pyar/Proyectos/CDPedia |title=CDPedia (Python Argentina) |accessdate=July 7, 2011[/tpl] Also: "Wikipedia for Schools", the Wikipedia series of CDs/DVDs, produced by Wikipedians and SOS Children, is a free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the UK National Curriculum and intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world.[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Wikipedia CD Selection|Wikipedia CD Selection[/tpl]. Retrieved September 8, 2009. The project is available online; an equivalent print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes.
* Books – There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[tpl]Cite news|title=Wikipedia turned into book|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5549589/Wikipedia-turned-into-book.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jeCgQjpj|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=June 16, 2009|accessdate=September 8, 2009|archivedate=September 8, 2009 [/tpl]Wikipedia Selection for Schools. Retrieved September 8, 2009. Since 2009, tens of thousands of print on demand books which reproduced English, German, Russian and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.
* Semantic Web – The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, is a project that extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia and makes it available in a queriable semantic format, RDF. The possibility has also been raised to have Wikipedia export its data directly in a semantic format, possibly by using the Semantic MediaWiki extension. Such an export of data could also help Wikipedia reuse its own data, both between articles on the same language Wikipedia and between different language Wikipedias.Wikipedia to Add Meaning to Its Pages, Tom Simonite, Technology Review, July 7, 2010
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Database download|Wikipedia policies[/tpl] on data download Wikipedia publishes "dumps" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007 there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.Data dumps: Downloading Images, Wikimedia Meta-Wiki
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55%."Wikipedia Reference Desk," fetched February 17, 2010

====Mobile access[tpl]anchor|Wikipedia mobile access|Wikipedia mobile[/tpl]====

:See also: [tpl]srlink|Help:Mobile access[/tpl]
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed internet connection. In addition, Wikipedia content is now accessible through the mobile web.
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer mobile service was officially released,[tpl]cite web |title = Wikimedia Mobile is Officially Launched |url = http://techblog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/wikimedia-mobile-launch/ |date = June 30, 2009 |work = Wikimedia Technical Blog |accessdate =July 22, 2009 [/tpl] located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or the Palm Pre. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimise or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata (See [tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Metadata[/tpl]), such as geoinformation.[tpl]cite web |url = http://androgeoid.com/2011/04/local-points-of-interest-in-wikipedia/ |title = Local Points Of Interest In Wikipedia |date = May 15, 2011 |accessdate =May 15, 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url = http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/15802/ |title = iPhone Gems: Wikipedia Apps |date = November 30, 2008 |accessdate =July 22, 2008 [/tpl]

==Impact==

===Sister projects - Wikimedia===

Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. The first, "In Memoriam: September 11 Wiki,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sep11memories.org/wiki/In_Memoriam |title=In Memoriam: September 11, 2001 |accessdate=February 6, 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2011[/tpl] created in October 2002,First edit to the wiki[tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] In Memoriam: September 11 wiki (October 28, 2002), detailed the September 11 attacks; this project was closed in October 2006.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] Wiktionary, a dictionary project, was launched in December 2002;"Announcement of Wiktionary's creation," December 12, 2002. Retrieved on February 2, 2007. Wikiquote, a collection of quotations, a week after Wikimedia launched, and Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts. Wikimedia has since started a number of other projects, including Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia; Wikinews, for citizen journalism; and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. Of these, only Commons has had success comparable to that of Wikipedia. Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalogue of species.

===Impact on publishing===

Some observers have stated that Wikipedia represents an economic threat to publishers of traditional encyclopedias, who may be unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. Nicholas Carr, wrote a 2005 essay, "The amorality of Web 2.0", that criticized websites with user-generated content, like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the time." Carr wrote, "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening." Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine, wrote in Nature that the "wisdom of crowds" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals, with their rigorous peer review process.[tpl]cite web| title = Technical solutions: Wisdom of the crowds | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature04992.html | work = Nature | accessdate=October 10, 2006 [/tpl]

===Cultural significance===

In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. According to Alexa and comScore, Wikipedia is among the ten most visited websites worldwide. The growth of Wikipedia has been fueled by its dominant position in Google search results; about 50% of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google, a good portion of which is related to academic research. The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009. The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. In October 2006, the site was estimated to have a hypothetical market value of $580 million if it ran advertisements.
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1346311_code835394.pdf?abstractid=1346311|title=Wikipedian Justice|format=PDF|accessdate=June 9, 2009[/tpl] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related links" section of its "further reading" list for the Civil Marriage Act.LEGISinfo – House Government Bill C-38 (38–1), LEGISINFO (March 28, 2005) The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the U.S. Federal Courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization – though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case. Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some U.S. intelligence agency reports. In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.
Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[tpl]Cite news|title=Wikipedia in the Newsroom |url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4461 |date=February/March 2008 |publisher=American Journalism Review|first=Donna |last=Shaw |accessdate=February 11, 2008[/tpl] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.Shizuoka newspaper plagiarized Wikipedia article, Japan News Review, July 5, 2007"Express-News staffer resigns after plagiarism in column is discovered," San Antonio Express-News, January 9, 2007."Inquiry prompts reporter's dismissal," Honolulu Star-Bulletin, January 13, 2007.
In July 2007 Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/pip/efv21/|title=Radio 4 Documentary |accessdate=December 26, 2008[/tpl] which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the term is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar (Google, Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation and are on a par with such 20th-century terms as Hoovering or Coca-Cola.
On September 28, 2007 Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the Minister of Cultural Resources and Activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website" to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grillini.it/show.php?4885|title=Comunicato stampa.

On September 16, 2007 The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 U.S. election campaign, saying, "Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day." An October 2007 Reuters article, titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol," reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.

====Awards====

Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004."Trophy Box," [tpl]srlink|Wikipedia:Meta|Meta-Wiki[/tpl] (March 28, 2005). The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community" category.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/winners-2004.php|title=Webby Awards 2004|publisher=The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences|year=2004|accessdate=June 19, 2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] Wikipedia was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby.

====Satire====

Many parody Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on". Another example can be found in a front-page article in The Onion in July 2006, with the title "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/content/node/50902 |title=Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years Of American Independence |accessdate=October 15, 2006 |year=2006 |work=The Onion[/tpl] Others draw upon Wikipedia's motto, such as in "The Negotiation", an episode of The Office, where character Michael Scott says: "Wikipedia is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information." "My Number One Doctor", a 2007 episode of the TV show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unserious reference tool with a scene in which Dr. Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.Bakken, Janae. "My Number One Doctor"; Scrubs; ABC; December 6, 2007 In one episode of 30 Rock, Pete and Frank add nonsensical information to the Janis Joplin Wikipedia page after telling Jenna that she should look it up to learn more about her, as, since Wikipedia could be edited by anybody, it was the most informative research because they find out more every day.
In 2008, the comedic website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/video/3581424/professor-wikipedia |title=Professor Wikipedia – CollegeHumor Video |publisher=CollegeHumor |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=April 19, 2011[/tpl] In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/bigipedia/interview/|title=Interview With Nick Doody and Matt Kirshen|publisher=British Comedy Guide|accessdate=July 31, 2009[/tpl]
In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0, to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing.Your Wikipedia Entries on Comedy Central (February 3, 2010)Wikipedia Updates on Comedy Central (February 3, 2010)

A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from over 1 million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative. Everything2 was created in 1998. All of these projects had similarities with Wikipedia, but were not wikis and neither gave full editorial privileges to public users.
GNE, an encyclopedia which was not a wiki, also created in January 2001, co-existed with Nupedia and Wikipedia early in its history; however, it has been retired.
Other websites centered on collaborative knowledge base development have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu, Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia. Scholarpedia also focuses on ensuring high quality.
A number of published biological databases now use wikis.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/nar/gkr1195[/tpl][tpl]Relevance note|This needs expansion to clarify how the relation to Wikipedia goes beyond the usage of a wiki engine|date=May 2012[/tpl]
