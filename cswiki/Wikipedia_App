A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on hand-held devices. These apps are accessed via App Store (iOS),Windows Store and Google Play. Some apps load content from the Wikipedia site and process it; other apps use the MediaWiki API. 
For each listing, to give a flavor of the app, 1-2 sentences from the app developer's promotional blurbs are listed for each. To limit this list to only notable apps, only currently available apps listed in major app blogs like "148 Apps"http://www.148apps.com/search/wikipedia or traditional news/media are included, with closely similar apps condensed to one. Also, only English-language apps are listed. 

== Reading and browsing apps ==

These apps' primary objective is to display articles. Typical features include searching for articles, bookmarks, sharing, or enlarging images. They differ in details of their user interface.
