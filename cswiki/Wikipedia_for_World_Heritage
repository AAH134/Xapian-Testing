Wikipedia for World Heritage refers to the efforts put forth to get Wikipedia listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The idea was originally proposed to the Wikipedia chapter by Wikimedia at the 2011 Wikimedia Conference in Berlin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Conference_2011/Documentation/Common_Project_I:_10_years_Wikipedia|title=Wikimedia Conference 2011/Documentation/Common Project I: 10 years Wikipedia|publisher=Wikimedia Meta-Wiki|accessdate=27 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/technology/23wikipedia.html|title=Worthy Online Resource, but Global Cultural Treasure?|last=O'Brien|first=Kevin J.|date=23 May 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=27 May 2011[/tpl] An online petition was started at the German Wikipedia on May 23, 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/8538333/Wikipedia-seeks-World-Heritage-Site-status.html|title=Wikipedia seeks World Heritage Site status|last=Williams|first=Christopher|date=May 26, 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 May 2011[/tpl] The bid is considered to be the first for a digital entity and is expected to be controversial with the list's maintainers who are notably conservative.
Jimbo Wales has stated that "the basic idea is to recognize that Wikipedia is this amazing global cultural phenomena that has transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people."
If Wikipedia fails to get listed as a World Heritage Site, it has been suggested that they apply for UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.
