References to Wikipedia in culture have increased as more people learn about and use the online encyclopedia project. Many parody Wikipedia's openness, with characters vandalising or modifying articles. Still others feature characters using the references as a source, or positively comparing a character's intelligence to Wikipedia. Also, the encyclopedia many times is not used as an encyclopedia at all, but instead serves more as a character trait or even as a game. Wikipedia has also become culturally significant with many individuals seeing the presence of a Wikipedia entry as a status symbol.[tpl]cite news |author= Jennifer Ablan |title=Wikipedia page the latest status symbol |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2232893820071022?sp=true |publisher=Reuters  |date=July 8, 2007 |accessdate=November 22, 2008[/tpl]

==Cases==

===Wikiality===

In a July 2006 episode of the satirical comedy The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert announced the neologism "wikiality," a portmanteau of the words Wiki and reality, for his segment "The Wørd". Colbert defined wikiality as "truth by consensus" (rather than fact), modeled after the approval-by-consensus format of Wikipedia. He ironically praised Wikipedia for following his philosophy of truthiness, in which intuition and consensus is a better reflection of reality than fact:
 You see, any user can change any entry, and if enough other users agree with them, it becomes true. ... If only the entire body of human knowledge worked this way.  And it can, thanks to tonight's word: Wikiality. Now, folks, I'm no fan of reality, and I'm no fan of encyclopedias.  I've said it before.  Who is Britannica to tell me that George Washington had slaves?  If I want to say he didn't, that's my right.  And now, thanks to Wikipedia, it's also a fact.
 We should apply these principles to all information.  All we need to do is convince a majority of people that some factoid is true. ... What we're doing is bringing democracy to knowledge.The Colbert Report / Comedy Central recording of The WØRD "Wikiality", Comedy Central, July 31, 2006.According to Stephen Colbert, together "we can all create a reality that we all can agree on; the reality that we just agreed on."  During the segment, he joked: "I love Wikipedia... any site that's got a longer entry on truthiness than on Lutherans has its priorities straight." Colbert also used the segment to satirize the more general issue of whether the repetition of statements in the media leads people to believe they are true.  The piece was introduced with the tagline "The Revolution Will Not Be Verified", referencing the lack of objective verification seen in some articles.
Colbert suggested that viewers change the elephant page to state that the number of African elephants has tripled in the last six months.[tpl]Cite news|title=Colbert speaks, America follows: All Hail Wikiality!|publisher=c-net news.com|url=http://news.com.com/2061-10802_3-6100754.html|author=Caroline McCarthy|date=August 1, 2006[/tpl] The suggestion resulted in numerous incorrect changes to Wikipedia articles related to elephants and Africa.[tpl]ref|Wikiality[/tpl] Wikipedia administrators subsequently restricted edits to the pages by anonymous and newly created user accounts.
Colbert went on to type on a laptop facing away from the camera, claiming to be making the edits to the pages himself. In addition, initial edits to Wikipedia corresponding to these claimed "facts" were made by a user named Stephencolbert. Thus, many believe Colbert himself vandalized several Wikipedia pages at the time he was encouraging other users to do the same. The account, whether it was Stephen Colbert himself or someone posing as him, has been blocked from Wikipedia indefinitely.[tpl]cite news | url=http://spring.newsvine.com/_news/2006/08/01/307864-stephen-colbert-causes-chaos-on-wikipedia-gets-blocked-from-site | title=Colbert Causes Chaos on Wikipedia | publisher=Newsvine | date=August 1, 2006 | accessdate=September 28, 2006[/tpl] Wikipedia blocked the account not for the vandalism (as believed), but for violating Wikipedia's username policies, which state that using the names of celebrities as login names without permission is inappropriate.
