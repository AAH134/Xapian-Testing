WinPepi is a freeware package of statistical programs for epidemiologists, comprising seven programs with over 120 modules. WinPepi is not a complete compendium of statistical routines for epidemiologists but it provides a very wide range of procedures, including those most commonly used and many that are not easy to find elsewhere. This has repeatedly led reviewers[tpl]who|date=January 2012[/tpl] to use a "Swiss army knife" analogy. Each program has a comprehensive fully referenced manual. 
WinPepi had its origins in 1983 in a book of programs for hand-held calculators,.Abramson JH, Peritz E: Calculator Programs for the Health Sciences. New York: Oxford University Press; 1983. In 1993, this was developed into a set of DOS-based computer programs by Paul M. Gahlinger with the assistance of one of the original authors of calculator programs, Prof. JH Abramson Gahlinger PM, Abramson JH: Computer Programs for Epidemiologic Analysis. Honolulu, Hawaii: Makapuu Medical Press; 1993. that came to be called Pepi (an acronym for "Programs for EPIdemiologists") and evolved, after its fourth version in 2001,Abramson JH, Gahlinger PM: Computer Programs for Epidemiologists: PEPI v.4.0. Salt Lake City, Utah: Sagebrush Press; 2001. into WinPepi (Pepi-for-Windows).[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1742-5573-1-6 | year = 2004 | month = December | author = Abramson, Jh | title = WINPEPI (PEPI-for-Windows): computer programs for epidemiologists | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | pmid = 15606913 | pmc = 544871 | journal = Epidemiologic perspectives & innovations : EP+I | url = http://www.epi-perspectives.com/content/1/1/6 | format = Free full text[/tpl] WinPepi is still a work in progress, and new expanded versions are issued.
The programs are notable for their user-friendliness. A portal links to programs and manuals. Menus, buttons, on-screen instructions, help screens, pop-up hints, and built-in error traps are also provided. The programs can also be operated from a USB flash drive.
WinPepi does not provide data management facilities. With some exceptions, it requires the entry (at the keyboard or by pasting from a spreadsheet or text file) of data that have already been counted or summarized.
