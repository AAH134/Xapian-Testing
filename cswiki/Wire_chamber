A multi-wire chamber (or just wire chamber) is a machine that detects charged particles and photons,F. Sauli,  - Principles of operation of multiwire proportional and drift chambers Retrieved 2012-02-25  functioning for gaseous ionization detection of particles of  ionizing radiation.  was located via  Dr. C.N.

==Description==

A proportional counter uses a wire, under high voltage, which runs through a metal or conductive enclosure whose walls are held at ground potential. The enclosure is filled with carefully chosen gas, such as an argon/methane mix, such that any ionizing particle that passes through the tube will ionize surrounding gaseous atoms. The resulting ions and electrons are accelerated by the electric field around the wire, causing a localised cascade of ionization which is collected on the wire and results in an electric current proportional to the energy of the detected particle. This allows the experimenter to count particles and importantly, in the case of the proportional counter, to determine their energy.
Adaptions of design are the thin gap, resistive plate and drift  chambers. The drift chamber is also sub-divided into ranges of specific use in the chamber designs known as   time projection,  microstrip gas, and those types of detectors that use silicon.I.

==Development==

The Mw chamber is a development of the spark chamber.   In 1968, Georges Charpak, while at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in CERN, invented and developed  the multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC). 
The chamber was an advancement of the earlier bubble chamber rate of detection of only one or two particles every second to 1000 particle detections every second. The MWPC  produced electronic signals from particle detection allowing scientists to examine data via computers.Computers in Physics, Sep/Oct 1992 - The Polish Language School for Foreign Students - Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań - European Organization for Nuclear Research Retrieved 2012-02-25H.

==Methodology==

The chamber is used as containing in typical experimental conditions a mixture of the gases argon, isobutane and freon at the relative proportions of two thirds of the first gas, with almost one third of the second and a much smaller percentage (0.5%) of the third.  Other substances used to fill the chamber include liquid xenon,S.E.Derenzo - SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,  Stanford University ( U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science );  )

==Use==

The development of the chamber enabled scientists to study the trajectories of particles with much improved precision, in addition to which, to also for the first time observe and study the rarer interactions that occur through particle interaction. The Mw chamber is an advancement  of the proportional chamber that has the capacities to measure the energies of particles instead of just the measurement of number of particles as in previous detection  by counters, for example the Geiger counter.K Taggart St George's College Weybridge Retrieved 2012-02-28 This is achieved by a change to the sensory apparatus of the instrument in that instead of one anode wire surrounded by a cathode plate,  a number of equadistant wires provide sensory information from within  two parallel plates..Nobel Media AB 2012 educational Retrieved 2012-02-28 
For high energy physics experiments, it is also valuable to observe the particle's path. For a long time, bubble chambers were used for this purpose, but with the improvement of electronics, it became desirable to have a detector with fast electronic read-out. (In bubble chambers, photographs were made, printed and then looked through.)  A wire chamber is a chamber with many parallel wires, arranged as a grid and put on high voltage, with the metal casing being on ground potential. As in the Geiger counter, a particle leaves a trace of ions and electrons, which drift toward the case or the nearest wire, respectively. By marking off the wires which had a pulse of current, one can see the particle's path.
The chamber has a very good relative time resolution, good positional accuracy, and a self-triggered operation (Ferbel 1977).(secondary)Physics & Philosophy:The Revolution in Modern Science Werner 1958 → http://www.archive.org/details/physicsandphilos010613mbp  "...the Position and the Momentum of a Particle Cannot Be Specified Simultaneously with Unlimited Precision..."  → http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zzxLTIljQB4C&pg=PA34&dq=Heisenberg+uncertainty+principle&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ImBGT8SWI4P38QPJyLWiDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Heisenberg%20uncertainty%20principle&f=false quoted in D A McQuarrie - Quantum Chemistry - (secondary R.Cli (M.Jammer) -Uncertainty Principle- The Oxford Companion to Philosophy ISBN 0-19-866132-0] )  Retrieved 2012-02-23  → J.Papa - The Institute of Optics - University of Rochester - ...not possible to know simultaneously the position and momentum of particles... -  (secondary - R.

==Drift chambers==

If one also precisely measures the timing of the current pulses of the wires and takes into account that the ions need some time to drift to the nearest wire, one can infer the distance at which the particle passed the wire. This greatly increases the accuracy of the path reconstruction and is known as a drift chamber.
The drift chamber functions by balancing the loss of energy from particles caused by impacts with particles of gas, with the accretion of energy created with high-energy electrical fields in use to cause the particle acceleration.
Design is similar to the Mw chamber but instead with central layer wires  at a greater distance apart.  The detection of charged particles within the chamber is  possible by the ionizing of particles of gas due to the motion of the charged particle.
The Fermilab detector CDF II contains a drift chamber called the Central Outer Tracker. The chamber contains argon and ethane gas, and wires separated by 3.56 millimetres gaps.Fermilab - glossary-photo- J. L. Lee Retrieved 2012-02-12
If two drift chambers are used with the wires of one orthogonal to the wires of the other, both orthogonal to the beam direction, a more precise detection of the position is obtained. If an additional simple detector (like the one used in a veto counter) is used to detect, with poor or null positional resolution, the particle at a fixed distance before or after the wires, a tri-dimensional reconstruction can be made and the speed of the particle deducted from the difference in time of the passage of the particle in the different part of the detector. This setup gives up the detector called Time Projection Chamber (often written just TPC)
For measuring the velocity of the electrons in a gas (drift velocity) there are special drift chambers, Velocity Drift Chambers which measure the drift time for known location of ionisation.
