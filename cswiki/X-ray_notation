X-ray notation is a method of labeling atomic orbitals that grew out of X-ray science. It is still traditionally used with most x-ray spectroscopy techniques including AES and XPS. In X-ray notation, every principal quantum number is given a letter associated with it.

*X-ray sources are classified by the type of material and orbital used to generate them. For example, CuKÎ± X-rays are emitted from the K orbital of copper.
*X-ray absorption is reported as which orbital absorped the x-ray photon. In EXAFS and XMCD the L-edge or the L absorption edge is the point where the L orbital begins to absorp x-rays.
*Auger peaks are identified with three orbital definitions, for example KL1L2. In this case, K represents the core level hole, L1 the relaxing electron's initial state, and L2 the emitted electron's initial energy state.
