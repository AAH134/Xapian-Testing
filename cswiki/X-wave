In physics, X-waves are localized solutions of the wave equation that travel at a constant velocity in a given direction. X-waves can be sound, electromagnetic, or gravitational waves. They are built as a non-monochromatic superposition of Bessel beams.  X-waves carry infinite energy. Electromagnetic X-waves travel faster than the speed of light. Finite-energy realizations have been observed in various frameworks.
In optics, X-waves solution have been reported within a quantum mechanical formulation.A. Ciattoni and C. Conti, Quantum electromagnetic X-waves arxiv.org 0704.0442v1.
