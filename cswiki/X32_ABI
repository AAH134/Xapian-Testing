x32 ABI (Application Binary Interface) is an under development Linux project that allows programs compiled for the x32 ABI to run in the 64-bit mode of x86-64 while only using 32-bit pointers and data fields.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-x32-ABI-gets-around-64-bit-drawbacks-1342061.html |title=Kernel Log: x32 ABI gets around 64-bit drawbacks |publisher=www.h-online.com |author=Thorsten Leemhuis |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2011-11-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://linuxplumbersconf.org/2011/ocw/sessions/531 |title=x32 - a native 32-bit ABI for x86-64 |publisher=linuxplumbersconf.org |accessdate=2012-06-12[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/ |title=x32-abi |publisher=Google Sites |accessdate=2011-11-01[/tpl] Though this limits the program to a virtual address space of 4 GB it also decreases the memory footprint of the program and in some cases can allow it to run faster. The best results during testing were with the 181.mcf SPEC CPU 2000 benchmark in which the x32 ABI version was 32% faster than the x86-64 version.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/CINT2000/181.mcf/docs/181.mcf.html |title=181.mcf SPEC CPU2000 Benchmark Description File |publisher=Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation |date=1999-10-14 |accessdate=2011-11-01[/tpl] On average x32 is 5-8% faster on the SPEC CPU integer benchmarks compared to x86-64 but it can as likely be much slower. There is no speed advantage over x86-64 in the SPEC CPU floating point benchmarks.

==History==

Several people had discussed the benefits of an x86-64 ABI with 32-bit pointers in the years since the Athlon 64's release in 2003, notably Donald Knuth in 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/news08.html |title= Recent News: A Flame About 64-bit Pointers |author=Donald Knuth |date=February 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl] There was little publicly-visible progress towards implementing such a mode until August 27, 2011, when H. Peter Anvin announced to the Linux kernel mailing list that he and H.J. Lu had been working on x32-abi.[tpl]cite web |url=http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1184876 |title= RFD: x32 ABI system call numbers |author=H. Peter Anvin |date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=15 May 2012[/tpl]
That same day Linus Torvalds replied with a concern that the use of 32-bit time values in the x32 ABI could cause problems in the future.[tpl]cite news |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/456731/ |title=The x32 system call ABI |publisher=LWN.net |author=Jonathan Corbet |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-11-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/456750/ |title=Re: RFD: x32 ABI system call numbers |publisher=LWN.net |author=Linus Torvalds |date=2011-08-26 |accessdate=2011-11-01[/tpl] This is because the use of 32-bit time values would cause the time values to overflow in the year 2038. The developers of the x32 ABI are planning to change the time values to 64-bit.[tpl]cite news |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/456760/ |title=Re: RFD: x32 ABI system call numbers |publisher=LWN.net |author=H.

A presentation at the Linux Plumbers Conference on September 7, 2011 covered the x32 ABI.
The x32 ABI was merged into the Linux kernel for the 3.4 release.
