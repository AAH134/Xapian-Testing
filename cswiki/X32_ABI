x32 ABI (Application Binary Interface) is an under development Linux project that allows programs compiled for the x32 ABI to run in the 64-bit mode of x86-64 while only using 32-bit pointers and data fields.

==History==

Several people had discussed the benefits of an x86-64 ABI with 32-bit pointers in the years since the Athlon 64's release in 2003, notably Donald Knuth in 2008.
That same day Linus Torvalds replied with a concern that the use of 32-bit time values in the x32 ABI could cause problems in the future.
A presentation at the Linux Plumbers Conference on September 7, 2011 covered the x32 ABI.
The x32 ABI was merged into the Linux kernel for the 3.4 release.
