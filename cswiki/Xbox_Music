==History==

Microsoft had previously ventured into music services with its Zune brand. The Zune Music Marketplace included 11 million tracks. The line of Zune players and Zune music store were somewhat unsuccessful, and the brand was largely discontinued at the beginning of the 2010s, although it continued to exist on different devices and the Zune Music Pass offered unlimited access to songs for 9.99 USD per month.http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/06/30-million-track-xbox-music-service-coming-from-microsoft/
Meanwhile, Microsoft had been emphasizing the strength of its Xbox brand because of its appeal to consumers. It had been expanding the multimedia services available through its Xbox Live to include services such as a video store and online game marketplace. It decided to introduce a new music service to build upon these existing features.
Microsoft introduced the new service at its press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012 on June 4.

==Functionality==

Xbox Music will be available for the Xbox 360 video game console, Windows Phone smartphones, and Windows 8 PCs. The availability across a variety of devices coordinates well with the Microsoft strategy of presence and integration on all devices. Analyst Michael Gartenberg believes the service will be available on iOS devices.
The announcement of the Xbox Music service launched speculation about Xbox Video,[tpl]speculation-inline[/tpl] a potential service that would offer movies and television series, because the term music in the name of the service gives an impression that Xbox Music will offer strictly music, thus excluding movies and television series.[tpl]speculation-inline[/tpl] Xbox Live Marketplace's Video Store was taken over by Zune Marketplace on September 15, 2009. It is not clear whether Microsoft will release a service called Xbox Video.http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/04/r-i-p-zune/?gwh=1818F7B4C81CF40620BD1DAF97C2554D
The service provides a variety of methods to access content: through an online store for permanent purchases, via subscription, and through radio. The service will offer 30 million tracks. However, it is not known whether Xbox Music will offer a similar inexpensive subscription as Zune Music Pass.
