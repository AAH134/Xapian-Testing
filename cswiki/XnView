XnView is a cross-platform image viewer used for viewing, converting, organising and editing graphical & video files. It is free of charge for private, educational and non-profit organisations. For commercial use and distribution, the user must register the program.
It is popular with users as it provides features normally found only in commercial image viewers.

== Features ==

XnView is highly customisable and multi-lingual, supporting 44 languages in the Windows version. The language can be changed via the options menu. The toolbar buttons can be modified to a certain extent, or be replaced by altering skins.
Also, XnView has been able to support an increasing number of file formats (mainly image file formats). It can read more than 400 image file formats, some audio and video file formats, and write 50 image file formats. XnView also supports ICC profiles in JPEG, PNG and TIFF files.
XnView can show IPTC, Exif and XMP metadata, and write IPTC metadata (but cannot do batch writing of IPTC metadata, and some users are longing for the batch IPTC editing function).XnView :: View topic - Extending IPTC / EXIF / XMP batch editing A further limitation is that it currently does not allow to sort thumbnails within a folder by a user-defined order.XnView :: Voir le sujet - moving files within folder
XnView can search files that have the same filename or data, and can search for similar graphics as well.
In addition, the display of the histogram of a picture is possible. And within a few mouse clicks, scripts can be created to convert, manipulate and rename a batch of images in one go.
Several image editing tools are included, for instance color and size manipulation, several filters and effects (full version even includes Harry's Filters 3.0). Lossless (without new encoding) turning, flipping and cropping of JPEG files is supported. Creation of advanced slide shows is also possible. Furthermore, it can upload images to an FTP site or ImageShack, burn images to a CD or DVD (Nero Burning ROM required) with a few clicks (full version only).
The author no longer uses exe compressors to compress executables in the newest version, 1.95, after a long discussion about XnView 1.95 rc1 in the official forum.XnView :: View topic - XnView 1.95 rc1XnView :: View topic - 1.95: Why did the executable increased so much in size?
XnView is accompanied by NConvert, a command line image conversion tool.
