ZSoft Uninstaller is a freeware software utility from ZSoft Software for the Microsoft Windows operating system. When programs are deleted using the default program uninstaller, it may leave behind some files and registry entries. ZSoft Uninstaller provides a way to completely remove leftover data by taking a snapshot of the hard drive and registry before and after program installation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Uninstallers/ZSoft-Uninstaller.shtml |title= Powerful yet easy-to-use uninstaller |accessdate=2011-12-24[/tpl]

==Features==

The main feature of ZSoft Uninstaller is to remove unnecessary files and registry entries left behind after uninstalling a program. It begins by analyzing the hard drive and registry before the program is installed. The user is then asked to install the program that they want to analyze. After the program is installed, ZSoft Uninstaller will reanalyze the same hard drive and registry, and compare the differences of the pre-installation with the post-installation. Each difference will be logged and the user can return at any time to delete the program and all of the files that were installed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zsoft.dk/index/software_details/4 |title= Software Details: ZSoft Uninstaller 2.5 |accessdate=2011-12-24[/tpl]
