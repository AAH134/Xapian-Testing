== History ==

In 1983 ZyLAB was the first company providing a full-text search program for electronic files stored in the file system of IBM Compatible PC’s. The program was called ZyINDEX. The first version of ZyINDEX was written in Pascal and worked on MS-DOS. Subsequent programs were written in C, C++ and C# and work on a variety of Microsoft operating systems.
In 1991, ZyLAB Integrated ZyINDEX with an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) program Calera Wordscan, which was a spin off from Raymond Kurzweil’s first OCR implementation. This integration was called ZyIMAGE. ZyIMAGE was the first PC program to include a fuzzy string search algorithm to overcome scanning and OCR errors.
In 1998, ZyLAB developed support to full-text search email, including attachments.
In 2000, ZyLAB embraced the new XML standard, and created a full content management and records management system based on the XML standard and build a full solution for e-discovery, historical archives, records management, document management, email archiving, contract management, and professional back-office solutions.
In 2003, ZyLAB invested in expanding the ZyIMAGE product suite with advanced Text analytics, Text mining, data visualization, computational linguistics, and automatic translation.
2005: ZyIMAGE Information Access Platform was released, an integrated solution to address Information Access problems.
2007: Platforms for ZyIMAGE e-Discovery and Legal Production, Historical Archiving, Compliance, Back-Office Records Management and COMINT were launched.
2010: ZyLAB Information Management Platform was released, an integrated solution to address eDiscovery and Information Management problems.
